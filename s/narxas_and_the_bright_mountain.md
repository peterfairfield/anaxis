# Narxas and the Bright Mountain

When Narxas became King of Eschar he built Annani a temple and when it was finished, he sent his messenger Lizuizos to Altir, the city of the Bright Mountain.

"The city of Eschar has been favored by Annani and all the peoples, the Shykel Erim, Cham, and Danoi have united into one. They speak to Aos with one language and with a single voice they declare: the favors of Annani have left Altir and settled on Eschar." 

Then the giant Hursamas Demonward was King of Altir, laughed when Lizuizos brought him the message. He sent back this message:

"When you have come to Altir and brought to me the gold of Eomer, the blood of Babbi Fran, and the tears of Annani, then I will declare to all of the Hadrad that they live under the dominion of Eshar."

When he heard the message, Narxas was overjoyed, and gathered the blood of Babbi Fran and the tears of Annani and put them into vessels. He sent to Ram's Shelf for the gold and filled 7 wagons with Eomer's gold. He sent them ahead of the Host and laid seige to the Bright Mountain.

The giant Hursamas heard that Narxas was coming with the Host and became worried. He went out from Altir and met him in the forest. He found that Narxas had become ill and was resting in a salt cave. He attacked the soldiers of the Lion that Narxas had posted outside the cave.

The camp was suprised, and Husamas killed anyone who stood against him. He devoured the soldiers of the Lion, and they found that he was unable to be defeated. Narxas came out of the cave and brought with him the gifts that Husamas had demanded. He said "here I am! here is the gold of Eomer, the blood of Babbi Fran and the tears of Annani."

Hursamas was astonished and bowed his head to Narxas. But while he was bowing, Babbi Fran approached him from behind and cut off his head. Then, returning to Eshar, they presented them to Annani and she separated the Hadrad of Hursamas thusly:

To the Erimesh and their clans: the silver hadrad.

To the Lakoizh: the black hadrad.

To the city of Altir: the red hadrad.

To the Danoi and their Augurs: the blue hadrad.

To the Taresh: the green hadrad.

To Ramesh of Ram's Shelf: the gold hadrad.

To the Mizrayim: the white hadrad.

But Babbi Fran refused to give the white hadrad to the Mizrayim, so Narxas locked them up in Tercel Tower. Narxas was angry with Babbi Fran because he had killed Hursamas and deied the hadrad for the Mizrayim.
