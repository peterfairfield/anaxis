# The Founding

There once was a city on a lake. The city grew large and prosperous, and the people of the city said to each other "let's take our boats and build a city on the coast, so we can catch the first fish as it comes out of the ocean." They took their boats and build Tarside on the coast and for many years they were happy.

There grew up in the city a boy named Aos, and he went wading in the rivermouth and found two rocks, Silver and Gold. He took the rocks and built two votives, one for the each of the rivers. 

Then the people of Ram's Shelf heard of the city of Tarside and they said to each other "Look, there are two great bowls, one made of gold and the other of silver! Let us take them and put them into our temple and if the people of Lagash want to stop us, we will feed them to the sharks!

And the people of Ram's Shelf came to Tarside and threw the fishermen of Lagash into the river and the sharks devoured them. But Eomer of the Wave Finder said to Babbi Fran, "if you can fill this ship with your children, we will take them to Ram's Shelf and lay waste to it's people". Then Babbi Fran put a tithe of his children on the boat, but still it did not sink. Then Kian Jan said to Babbi Fran, "The Finder floats, and can sail through the water, there is still room for more!" So Babbi Fran sent another tithe of his children. But Kian Jan said again "The Finder floats" and then Babbi Fran sent all of his children on board. They filled the Finder and hung from the hull.

Then Eomer set sail for Ram's Shelf and they did battle with the children of the sea. The Edo of Ram's Shelf sent 3 fleets against the Wave Finder, but the children of Babbi Fran still clung to the outside of the hull. The Edo sent three more fleets, and the children of Babbi Fran still clung to the outside of the hull. The Edo sent all of their fleets and the children of Babbi Fran came from the belly of the Wave Finder and cut them down like fish. For 50 days they fought and they laid waste to Ram's Shelf and destroyed it utterly.

The Eomer felt that his work was not done, but went and lived in a hut down by the river. There he met Rebecca Horne, the daughter of Babbi Fran, and they had three sons. When his sons were grown, he saw that they were playing Then the Finders said to the people of Eshar-in-the-sand. But General Narxas of heard that they were leaving, and gathered the Host and came after the Esharites. He came upon them like a lion, tearing at their children with his claws and devouring 100 of them with his huge jaws. The Finders brought the Esharites to Tercel tower, on the ruins of Tarside and killed any of the Lion's army that tried to cross the rivers.

Then the Lion cried to Yarash Tesh, which is Domdaniel and the Kraken stirred the waters of Kars Bay to mud. The Host crossed over the rivers on mats they threw down on the mud and attacked the city.

Then Babbi Fran came out of the city, and he brought with him the two bowls of silver and gold. He crowned General Narxas king of Eshar and Annani Queen of Lagash. But Narxas said "where are the Finders, go into the city and bring them to me", but Rebecca went to Tercel Tower and warned the Finders and in the night they fled to Ram's Shelf.
