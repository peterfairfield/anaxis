A huge monster tree. It tries to eat them, in a friendly way. It smells so sweet and it sings so gently. The island seems really pleasant, suddenly there are motes of light and everything sounds like it is far away. You can somehow see better, see clearer. The aboleth enters your mind for the first time. Agnus asks you what you most desire. You know you must tell the truth.</p>\n<p>This is when <a href=\"/p/rian.md\">Edo Rian</a> springs into action, if he’s still alive. He will mindblank them all with scrolls and then tells them to proceed as they wish. He will have the Spirit with him, if they let him have it, and maybe Option Bols, if he survived so far. Bols will meet Fred soon. That is going to be the tightest of bonds in the City, as it Changes. </p>\n<p>At the confrontation, if they can introduce to Agnus a solid connection within the Natural College, she will put off the war of succession. The seas can be at peace. It’ll be known as the 11 hours war. There was even a successful mutiny. Maybe the moon will come up. The Admiral’s College is in absolute uproar. Josriel is an Admiral and she will be running a squadrun of Host Ships to run them to ground, wherever they might be. This will come to be known as the First Fleet, as it is the first to go into the Moongate. When you go through, the boat is dumped upside down in the water, with you on the bottom. That’s about all. If the party is there, they get to meet the Sun King instead of Josriel. He will be swimming for his life off the Reed Island.</p>\n<p>Aftermath: someone was bound to slip up. Either they know more about Roma, Bore, Agnus, or Nain after this, or Silar will notice something and give them a mission to check up on, because he’s a smart guy. There is the mystery of the ship and of the disappearance of Saxon and Gladhand’s fleet.</p>\n",

There were 6 families living on the island, paid essentially to keep a really nice garden and fix things that broke.

They have a lot of eggs and milk stacking up, as well. This place has 4 large fishing boats, and is a <a href=\"/p/mushussu.md\">agricultural</a> powerhouse. Bolsingers uppergrads use this place to finish their projects and get a deep dive on the history of the harbor, or she will do a dramatized battle of the Pirate Kings, how they attacked and defeated 7 cities before coming to Eschar. Eschar stood with the sea, as it had always done, as the waters rose and fell of old. This is now the returning of the waters, not the rising.</p>\n<p>The drowned temple is hardly a secret, once you&#39;re on the island, you&#39;re on top of it. There are two main entrances on the island, the huge sea caves on the north side of the island and the temple in the centre. It is underwater.</p>\n",

The great and venereal society of the Most Ancient City. They are the ones trying to stab Fred in the back. The Opera will start this message, and imprint it in the minds of those.

The contact is the merchant Nain. Jefth will commission Captain <a href=\"/p/.md\">Buckfest</a>. Nain is a complete doucheweasel. He’s stolen the Tome from the Empire, and he’s kinda smug about it. They can find out that he somehow tricked the Regent of Lakash, in fact he used blackmail. He has an annoying habit of somehow knowing everything. He is always asking awkwardly personal questions and then following them up with shocking questions. He will tell them that he has enemies everywhere, and some point on the journey, he will become convinced that a sailor on the boat hates him and wants to kill him.</p>\n<p>The sailor on the boat hates him and is plotting to kill Farris, but they won’t reveal this until the rest of the crew can join them and take down the boat. The pirates come blasting out of the windward side of Kars Island, and bring a very large outrigger with aprox. 200 troops aboard. Buckfest makes a run for it, and he will reluctantly send up a signal for the Cutters, but it is too late, they cannot outrun the outrigger. The players may escape overboard, using their Deep Drafts, or they can stay and die. Buckfest will stay with the ship and will be most likely slain in the assault. If they escape, they will find the Docks and the Chippies swarming with agents of the Empire, mostly Erimesh who are mostly for hire, but also Ubiad agents. </p>\n<p>Skill challenge for the chase. Some Tearers add on, just for the Hunt. It is laundry day in the square, and soap gets everywhere. The horse-market is in full swing. A religious ceremony of worshippers of Obsidian blocks the path, or just a rundown Mammoth. If they are able to capture an Erimesh agent, he might be willing to tell him about his employers. The tome can be used to find an Isin artefact, the Lum, or small drinking pot, but it has to be translated, something the Empire wasn’t able to do, as it is written in Ramesh. In fact, there are few in the city who can read it and fewer who will admit it.</p>\n<p>They will have to go to ground, but if they go to Jefth’s it has been subverted, but that might not be obvious from the outside. They will have to find a place to go to ground. Farris will recommend the most obvious enemies of the Erimesh: the oldblood Esharites, or the Finders. If they don’t want to show this asshat the Bothy, they can stay with Lady Horne or Hiram, if they have good relations with them. At some point, things will get so dicey in the city that even these powerful allies will try to smuggle them out of the city. </p>\n<p>If they get out, or if they start to use the book (Finders, Ava, Bore can read it), it will lead them to Kess Island, and back into the Labyrinth, at which point the book should start to freak them out. It will take them through to the artefact, but they will run into some allies (hard to say, given where/when the artefact might be/be from) who want Farris dead and the book returned to their sactuary. They have a lodestone for the book. Before they can make friends or enemies, the Empire will catch up with them, and they’ll get jumped. Xorns, guys on horses, or ethereal spiders, something that can kinda run with the Tome. The players should have a chance to retrieve it, but if they don&#39;t the lodestone will guide them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-artefactcyst\">The Artefact/Cyst</h2>\n<p>They will need the book to get at the thing, but the Empire might have started on that before they arrive.

Tainted pirates, diseased corpses, all these are welcome as well.</li>\n<li>If he feels that the Moshkans are getting out of hand, he’ll intervene peacefully, and make diplomatic overtures</li>\n<li>He wants you to go after something big.</li>\n<li>He is rounding up people and you are helping or on that list?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"host-coverup\"><a href=\"/f/the_host.md\">Host Coverup</a></h3>\n<p>At this point, the Host will intervene and try to confiscate all of their evidence. If they resist the Tearers, they will be arrested, hopefully for something else they have done. If they allow themselves to be arrested, they can appeal to Bols, and if they manage to get an audience with him, but he’s likely to try to get them to do another  job.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-moveable-library\"><a href=\"/s/university_library#moving.md\">The Moveable Library</a></h3>\n<p>While the Natural College Library is going into an expansion phase, probably taking in content from the two other damaged libraries in town. Lord Saxon wants them to help move certain texts securely. Also helping is Bols and Ava Gavin, if she has been reconciled to Saxon, or perhaps Captain Buckfest if they need a boat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rock\"><a href=\"/l/the_rock.md\">The Rock</a></h3>\n<p>Bols has picked up Sarl, who was acting of a go-between for Mushussu, and has found out since the discovery of the forgeries that Mushussu (via Sarl) was using the Broken Leg as a deaddrop location. Sarl also had chalk, vellum and a flask of oil on him. Jobs might be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go and asses the viabillity of a defunct keep or tower as a base of operations. A large subterrain space would be great.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"kars-island\"><a href=\"/l/kars_island.md\">Kars Island</a></h3>\n<p>Forests hold sacred wood and even more importantly: spices and drugs. Bols is used to dealing with the locals respectfully but unknowns with extreme extradition. If there is a lull on Kars, Bols can show up and start searching door to door, with a band of Tearers. He has come overland from the other end of the iron road, and may meet them there, coming the opposite way. If the islands marines show up, they will halt in awe and Bols will move to assist them. Hiram&#39;s sailors he has little time for, but he WILL insist on registering all of the unregistered crew among them.</p>\n<p>Hiram will not be happy about Bols’ presence, but will try to move quickly to put the blame on the crones and frame their actions in the most dangerous light. They have made an infernal pact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-harbor-light\"><a href=\"/l/the_harbor_light.md\">The Harbor Light</a></h3>\n<p>Showdown between DeVerre and Philos, The Clerk. Bols is trying to prove he has the right to search the houses for Hatchaxel. DeVerre has to correct him, given the status of Orphanage “Keep no blood” qualifies as a Hospital, and outside 3 miles of the city.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bols has probably searched several houses by the time they stop him.</li>\n<li>Philos will interject that the canal allows a border search exception could allow them to search in hot pursuit.</li>\n<li>Bols will swat him down, he will mutter something to the tune of “and by the way, we have a probable suspicion that there is heroin in transit, by some ancient code or other, so they do have the right to examine the bowels of the islanders.</li>\n<li>DeVerre will point out that they are no longer, but if they could all get on with it, they could search the island together. In good faith, he will invite Bols to come with him.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"during-riotinvasion\"><a href=\"/r/riot.md\">During Riot/Invasion</a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>During crisis: there is a big fight here, it would be nice to have a map. Perhaps the cards are map tiles, with sigils on them. The fight should threaten the life or end the life of a close ally (Bols, for instance). Here are some examples<ol>\n<li>Transporting Prisoners – a cart of prisoners, perhaps the town council, maybe some enemies of the city?</li>\n<li>If Ava is part of the prisoners or conflict, she can tell them about the state of the attack that is going on.

His solution to the reigns considered too long, then, was to argue that &quot;[t]heir occurrence in our material must be ascribed to a tendency known also among other peoples of antiquity to form very exaggerated ideas of the length of human life in the earliest times of which they were conscious.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did you fireball my men?

Bore wanted to get married, so she did, but forced him to sign a prenup, giving her essentially nothing. They cannot find the prenup in their records, so they’ve come to the library to find a way out of this.</p>\n<p>This is a bit of how it went down: <a href=\"/p/roma.md\">Roma</a> had inherited a huge amount of money from her parent’s land, it was completely full of bitumen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"executor\">Executor</h3>\n<p>Most people know that it&#39;s &quot;big shot&quot;, but there aren&#39;t a lot of famous ones. Seems like a new title. Some project between the naval colleges and Host.</p>\n<p>He&#39;s very young for the position, but it came up with a wave of retirements. For many in this rocky political terrian, Bore is their shelter from the storm, holding the city together.

When the Host moved the Navy to Hook Island, there were workers from the Hill people brought in to build the infrastructre, farming patties, canals and bridges. Some of these hill people were highly skilled in these things and prominent amoung then was Tomas, Fred&#39;s father. He gave away all of his wealth to the less fortunate and lived by gifts from the community. King Solen began a decree that the bodies of the dead were to be brought to the necropolis and buried in the Hadrad style. It became illegal to burn corpses in the hill people style, or to leave them out for the birds. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>His father began burning the corpses of friends and family, and also people found him, asking to be allowed to pay to have their loved one burn, but once he knew of a body, he would go and burn it, so long as it was of the hill people. </p>\n<p>Then he was banished to the hills and all of his household moved to Tel Kur, but even there he was harried by the Host until he and his wife found a hut in the wilderness.  </p>\n<p>The Hadrad were driven from the city and from the right and left resevoirs. King Solen was slain by his sons, and the twins fled to Silver Mountain. The Youngest son inherited the position as Leader of Hosts. </p>\n<p>He hired Tomas&#39; brother Deverre to oversee the rebuilding (The Current Lord Deverre&#39;s adoptive father) of the city. He invited Tomas to return and reestablish his place in the City, but he returned to Tell Kur and made a safe place for the hill people there.</p>\n<p>The Lords of the City sent a man to kill Tomas, but Tomas was able to convince him that he was innocent of the plot he was accused of, and they were able to fake his death.</p>\n<p>His son was sent to Deverre for safekeeping, and to remove suspicion. Fred grew up by the lighthouse, best friends with Deverre&#39;s son, John.</p>\n<p>There is something Babbi Fran has revealed to Tomas that will cure Ava of her curse. It may have to do with the wolf blood. It may actually be driving out a demon, or something like that.</p>\n<p>Fred: I&#39;m not here to take your city away. I&#39;m here to make sure you have a home to come back to, Keep no Blood.</p>\n",

It moved like rough cloth and covered his neck. It was dyed or stainded or powder-coated in something that made it really red. In his hands he held a helmet of horns, which he sat down and bid me and Erwin to sit next to. When he motioned, I could see that could see that there were 15 more tall figures all clad in green... And so I sat. He sat then and asked me: &quot;Do you know why we are here?&quot; -- I said it couldn&#39;t be all that bad, with trade and whatnot and how&#39;s about the higher learnin&#39; and all Que Lorisumpisuemus he&#39;s talkin&#39; Urchar. He askes me about the Pacts and I tells him some things he didn&#39;t know and pretty quick he&#39;s sent his army, (cause there was more than 16) back North, but he&#39;s put on his hat. Run away!&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then, because this guy is such a jerk he always keeps something back, if they convince him further:</p>\n<p>&quot;And then he and his 5 generals gathered. I thought at first they were generals. But I realize now that I&#39;d taken the badge of reds vs greens vs blacks as ranks: Red was commanders? Blacks were scouts, Greens were heavies.</p>\n<p>But.. that wasn&#39;t how it worked. The ranks kinda followed those lines, but the colors didn&#39;t really mean anything at all -- there was no rank difference between them.</p>\n<p>But they kept separated from the others. I was with that army for 5 hours while they got on the kinda horseflesh you&#39;d shiv two biddies for. </p>\n<p>Well, then I figured as much, and then they all took off.</p>\n<p>And so I think you should and so do you?</p>\n<p>You think you&#39;ve figured me out! I&#39;m a bad guy! Look at what I&#39;ve learned from this, then decide if you want to kill me! Let me be on trial!</p>\n<p>This will be a particularily sweet moment if they are using Aunt Agnus or her saltboxes, when she sails into the room or (if they bring him back) into the courtbench. Or if they bring him back, Fallstaff. Maybe, every time they use the spell, he is there somehow, in the background, hidden like an octopus, watching in the waters. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my fault, that this is where I live?&quot; The minds reach out and follow their prey.</p>\n<p>His eyes snap open, and hope quickens his lips:</p>\n<p>&quot;There she is, my dark lady! How&#39;re you, Auntie? Did I run an rum game?&quot;</p>\n<p>yes -- and no</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, I have tucked away behind my ear? What is this?

This might be how they Meat Aunt Agnus for nicers the second time, and establish a relationship. If she helps them escape and peg this fuckmonkey, </p>\n",

He is, of course, partially right. The security surrounding the brains was obscurity, and he is quick to point out his innocence by trying his best to help them. Lamark is hiding something, however, he has imprinted several of the brains on himself and is slowly going mad, remembering stuff from the Flint House attack, and things from the diary. He is also not a real Beowulf, but is a Finder playing Hal from the Host, who need him badly. He doesn’t want them to find that out, but he&#39;s bad at keeping secrets, so he just keeps his mouth shut sometimes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"private-collector\">Private Collector</h2>\n<p>He is a collector and professor at Beowulf. Lamark began with Fallstaff at Natural College, but was hired by The Host to begin development a College of the Mind at Beowulf.</p>\n<h2 id=\"archeology\">Archeology</h2>\n<p>Lamark will invite them to do something for house <a href=\"/l/beowulf_castle.md\">Beowulf</a>, he might offer them a lesson in brain-archeology. His madness is mitigated by a ticture of fish guts, which he says clears his head. While they are meeting with him, he will be assassinated, and in way that will be highly suspicious. There will be warrents out all over the city. The party will look incredibly guilty and <a href=\"/p/nate.md\">Nate Hound</a> will come after them hard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-party-hunt\">The Party Hunt</h2>\n<p>First, if they go charging after the assassins, please let them randomly run into a pile of <a href=\"/f/the_tearers.md\">Tearers</a>, out for some blood for some reason or other. They pretty much cut loose. They will take this oppurtunity to put the players down. This could be a humorous fight until the bloodshed spreads and spreads as more Tearers join the fight. At some point, when actual Options start showing up, they will hopefully call it quits and flee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"paper-muster\">Paper Muster</h2>\n<p>Then it&#39;s a paper muster and patrols and the City goes haywire. First signs point them to Bolsinger&#39;s and professor <a href=\"/p/tobit_drake.md\">Tobit Drake</a>. If they go in guns blazing, they will find ample evidence that he&#39;s been spying on the Natural College and Falstaff&#39;s work. He will appear dead. If they are too agressive, his Deep Lord will protect him – maybe with enslaved guardsmen. If defeated, his spellbook and stuff are spectacular, but they will have a tough time with the <a href=\"/p/fallstaff.md\">Kraken</a> if they kill him. He does keep notes of the people who assassinated Lamark, however.</p>\n<p>If this goes well for them, throw the next encounter at them willy-nilly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tobit-drake\">Tobit Drake</h2>\n<p>If they seem reasonable, he will talk to them, but they will be interuptted by House Beowulf bruisers looking for answers with this lead they&#39;ve just been given by the assassins. They will come in at totally the wrong moment and ruin everything. Especially once they see what Tobit has been doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"edo-doubletap\">Edo Doubletap</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile they&#39;ve heard of another killing in the same Oevre as the assassins. It was another Edo, this should be one of the Edo insiders, possibly <a href=\"/p/reggie_the_lame.md\">Reggie</a>, more likely <a href=\"/p/beruni.md\">Beruni</a>, and probably killed down in the <a href=\"/l/harbor.md\">Harbor</a>. They find enough to identify him as a gravedigger for Lamark, and an Edo if they know what to look for. If they linger over the body, <a href=\"/p/siobane.md\">Siobane</a> will come over and offer to do a card reading. She slights the cards in a particular manner, denoting death rogue knight tower sun. They silver her, or perhaps she curses them?</p>\n<h2 id=\"to-the-house-of-pain\">To the House of Pain</h2>\n<p>The next place is the only place in town that fit the Oevre perfectly at this point: Fillstorm. They will find him frantically working on this new animal he has found: an intellect devourer. He tells them that Lamark threatened to syc his Beowulf grunts on him unless he handed it over. He threatens him with retribution from the Kraken folks if he doesn&#39;t comply. As Prime Edo, Parson knows that this guy is from Aunt Agnus. </p>\n<p>&quot;He threatened everyone here. He said if I didn&#39;t have this to him tonight that I could look forward to a visit from the Beeves.&quot;</p>\n<p>He might give them clues to send them straight at Aunt Agnus, if he&#39;s worried about her, or have them take off after the assassins, but before he can those Beowulf Beefs show up. Ibid</p>\n<h2 id=\"moske-hideout\">Moske Hideout</h2>\n<p>The assassins have been trying to get to Shawn, but so far, just been picking at its agents. </p>\n<p>Showdown O&#39;clock, when they go after the Moske hideout. There are some reasonable people there who try to talk to them about what happened, but then the assassins show up in force.</p>\n<p>Falstaff&#39;s house is burning, probably the Flint House. If they find Falstaff he will say that this is all a cleanup on behalf of some higher-ups. He can tell them where those guys are, but they aren&#39;t going to like it.</p>\n<p>The Rock: and killing a lot of the right people. Some of them probably get away.</p>\n",

He is a big fat lyre, his tunes obsequies, but his intentions murderous. If Roma joins, the rest of the packs will submit -- they don&#39;t have any unity. He may even point this out to Roma, to try and catch her in something, perhaps it&#39;s about how she ran off to the city, and only comes home for family ceremonies. He promises her half power, as defined in the laws ex ramis. And that&#39;s it, if she looks up those laws, she will regret kiling him.

Oh, this is Vamarm Silar Gloryshield, and he just crowned himself king.

Roma cannot figure this guy out?)</p>\n<p>The Tower of Aunt Agnus\nBig Tentacles, oh my. The island has a lake, and the lake is deep. There are tentacles in the lake. A huge monster tree. It tries to eat them, in a friendly way. It smells so sweet and it sings so gently. The island seems really pleasant, suddenly there are motes of light and everything sounds like it is far away. You can somehow see better, see clearer. The aboleth enters your mind for the first time. Agnus asks you what you most desire. You know you must tell the truth.</p>\n<p>This is when <a href=\"/p/nain.md\">Edo Nain</a> springs into action, if he’s still alive. He will mindblank them all with scrolls and then tells them to proceed as they wish. #TODO He will have the Spirit with him, if they let him have it, and maybe Option Bols, if he survived so far. Bols will meet Fred soon. That is going to be the tightest of bonds in the City, as it Changes. </p>\n<p>At the confrontation, if they can introduce to Agnus a solid connection within the Natural College, she will put off the war of succession. The seas can be at peace. It’ll be known as the 11 hours war. There was even a successful mutiny. Maybe the moon will come up. The Admiral’s College is in absolute uproar. Josriel is an Admiral and she will be running a squadrun of Host Ships to run them to ground, wherever they might be. This will come to be known as the First Fleet, as it is the first to go into the Moongate. When you go through, the boat is dumped upside down in the water, with you on the bottom. That’s about all. If the party is there, they get to meet the Sun King instead of Josriel. He will be swimming for his life off the Reed Island.</p>\n<p>Aftermath: someone was bound to slip up. Either they know more about Roma, Bore, Agnus, or Nain after this, or Silar will notice something and give them a mission to check up on, because he’s a smart guy. There is the mystery of the ship and of the disappearance of Saxon and Gladhand’s fleet.</p>\n",

I was in a terrible pickle, with enemies quickly hunting me. Climbing up the cliff face where I now stand, I beheld the sun set upon the Long Lake, and my heart was lifted by the sight of the Akaerak Poles. There surrounding the lake were fishing poles and there rested the fishermen of Cham, hailing this ragged stranger standing on their slopes. They fed me and showed me how to fish in the Binding Lake for my supper.</p>\n<p>Later, these people took me to their sacred island which they once called the Eye. They showed me how to read the runes, and showed me how I might retake Isin. I called for clay and quill and wrote The City. Our last act before leaving the Far Shore had been to recapture the looted library of The Mind. We carefully translated these texts into Clay and founded the Universities. In 50 years we’d built the cities and roads. Then in 100 we conquered all the land around us, and freed their people to rule under their own leadership. 50 years ago, our policies with the Northern Alliance led to our partnership. What this all led to was the creation of the greatest army I have ever seen. Those fishermen, those northern traders, of cedar and silver. Those Keepers of the Chest of Tiamat.</p>\n<p>Now must I come to the matter at hand: so long as the moon holds the sky, the sea-road to Esh will remain open. This moon will not last long, perhaps 20 years. We will not leave these lands undefended. If we were to withdraw all armies at once, the chaos sewn in the outer reaches of the empire would be catastrophic, and the Northern Kingdoms would probably rebel. (Cheers) But I will only be taking half of all forces with me when I depart in 6 months. The rest of them will have their hands full rearming and training the next 39 waves of fleets.</p>\n<p>These will be very difficult years, for all of us, but the fate of those going in the ships will be worse. They will face foes unimaginable, and hordes innumerable. Isin has once again gone into a horrible Expansion, and has determined that this world will become subsumed. It’s mind and will have bent our way, and only through its own weapons do we dare oppose it. There will not sail a ship without a Bindstone aboard.</p>\n<p>Have you not felt the tug of Isin on your soul? A fatigue, a soullessness, that Mask of despair. Here I will  plant the first Iron Rose, to grow here from the city and provide it with Rose Iron. I will bind it with a blade crafted by my hand, the green glass.</p>\n<p>The ships I have brought were built in Isin. They are lined with gold, which is more easily available there.</p>\n<p>The first gift is gold &amp; economic collapse. The second is the invasion of the Empire. The third is the corruption of the Kraken.</p>\n<p>I have brought with me too much gold to put on the market all at once. Please let me know if you want to get into safely offloading a lot of gold. The first groups of people and any of their friends who are caught trying to get the gold, are going on the first ships that will begin to sail next week. The Deep and the Green are with us!</p>\n<p>When they step up to the flint house, they see the same sight. The sun setting, the fishermen, the island. Make that experience of the Adventure to the Eye, perhaps with silly details. The King, after all, is a fool.</p>\n",
