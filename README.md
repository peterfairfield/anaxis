#### /e *Events*

A timeline of sorts, this usually can be a series of things that happen leading up to an event, and some ideas for how the event might effect the storyline, with hooks to characters and triggers to other events. These are in rough shape, I'm working on templating them. Some examples:

 * [The Knight's Trial](/e/the_knights_trial.md)
 * [Mes Papri Debacle](/e/mes_papri_debacle.md)

#### /f *Factions*

Peoples, organizations, institutions etc. 

 * [Darker Faire](/f/darker_faire.md)
 * [The Silvermen](/f/the_silvermen.md)
 * [The University](/f/the_university.md)

#### /i *Items*

This is for specific objects of interest. Maybe could use some organizing.

#### /l *Locations*

Places, but you look for it under "l". These still have a lot of events under them.

 * [Kars Island](/l/kars_island.md)
 * [Halls of Aos](/l/halls_of_aos.md)
 * [Tel Kalam](/l/tell_kalam.md)

#### /p *People*

 * [Ava Gavin](/p/ava.md)
