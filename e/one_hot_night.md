> Yung will send someone to tell them of a missing person – someone’s daughter that he needs to get back in a quick and diplomatic way.

> Event: A Esharite Noblewoman is being an ass to the Erimesh and the Danoi. “Wolves from the hills” and “Flea-bitten barbarians in-exile”
Event: A man has clearly took too much Mull.

> Main Event: Edo Rian is a celebrated writer/author. Sciber Meatus has gone absolutely bonkers over this guy. Edo Rian is totally innocently mindshielded. Bols will steer them clear from trouble with him/it. Lady Horne is still looking for her daughter, after that last scandal, she wants to work directly with the players and is willing to pay cash. Her daughter has been hanging out with Edo Rian and his lowlifes down at the Chippies. Another Host Prime will have a missing daughter and will want to piggyback, if there is any news to be had.

### One Hot Night: The Goldsmith’s
There are two artisans working on casting a massive bronze sculpture. They have been up for 32 hours and are clearly bonkers. They are big fans of Rian’s, but they have heard that Rian lives with his parents. They’ve also heard about the rumors about the boggers.

### One Hot Night: Rian’s Parents
Edith and Jokim Sama
They are wealthy, but have little knowledge of what their son actually does at the docks, but they assume he is a quartermaster, and are just disappointed he hasn’t joined the Host. They don’t know what an Edo is, but they do have just the right amount of classism to say the right things about the Savants. They will however let the players know that he frequents [Ten Pins](/l/ten_pins.md).

### One Hot Night: Ten Pins
Yes Skyre Gowan Roan sells Mull, but she won’t tell them that unless she knows them, and knows they won’t sic the Hospitaller on her. Otherwise, she does know the Edos quite well, and can probably tell them more about Rian than anyone. Again, depending on how well they know each other, she can tell them that Rian has bought a new property on the w. Side of the Rock, on a very wealthy residential district called The Cliffs.

### One Hot Night: Dust mephits
Rian has purchased an old Chapter House of the Tearers (perhaps one that needed some rebranding) The chapter house is decorated with twisted iron and lots of strange alcoves. There may be secret rooms with things like stuffed mermaids and lycantropes, maybe an owlbear or some forest creatures, anything that makes the players angry. Rian has hired some thugs and spy5es to provide cover for the front doors. Inside, there are several young members of the higher houses of Eshar. If they want to take these folks back, they will either have to get Rian to dismiss them, or bring them by force.

Here is a map, and stats for the tearers and guardians of Askha'hle

### One Hot Night: Askha'hle

Askha'hle is kept prisoner by the Tearers at the old Chapter House (formerly the Brotherhood of Wolves). His phylactery is the Nagnag, a bronze spouted jar. If they save him from the Chapter House, he will become friends with them, and even try to take them out for a night on the town to rile whomever in the elite of the city they might currently be at odds with. He will otherwise be cold, although he might warm to them over an evening of Tuck Duck.
