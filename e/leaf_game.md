## The Leaf Game

This game began on the island of Kars, but now has spread throughout Obaian. They are concerned with the preservation of nature and the use of magic. The sea life in the area, as well as the forest life, meet on the strand for the cojoining of the field forest river and ocean. They also invite Natasha, as their favorite townie rep. When they meet you

1.  They will want you to stop a crime to nature, or convince you that you’re about to commit one.
    
2.  Give you a title, or a “Circle”, each circle is their own axis.
    
3.  Protect something from the outside
    
4.  Travel to the Green House, the Navy, or something with Wildshape – these will each involve jobs. Jobs should open up, or be determined by the current vertex.
    

They know a lot about the moon, almost more than anyone.

Within the Elder Circle there are 3 main characters. Moon, Death, chaos Ocean

The Game throws a Party

They are invited along with their Rebecca Horn. The Lower Halls may send Ehren Havelin and a group to keep things from breaking out in a fight. The Theatre will also be sending Obel (Scabb) or someone like him, along with some Baleheads.

The Three Trees
Huge Ash, Oak and Elder keep watch over this ancient grove. There are processions between the trees, and gift-giving. Lots of food and drink. Rumors here will talk of the movements of the Host into certain areas, the people are disappearing in the Forest.

The Madness
Infecting the whole party. A musician playing, she has escaped from the Hole, and madness is just? A fight breaks out, probably involving the party. The group attacking are a group from outside The Game, and they back down when the madness is quelled. Lord Saxon is very happy if no-one is killed. If they talk to the muscian they find out:

Clarissa the Geiger
The fiddle is made with bone and hair. She comes from an awful place. They call it Yarash Tesh, and it is a place of deprivation of mind and will. If they know most of how to get there, she can give them a story of what life was like. The mind was ripped apart, it isn’t so much that you have less will, but that it is spread thin, throughout the grass and trees. There is a long way to go into the wood.

They are jumped by Deep Pirates. They have sticky shields and nets. They are covered in grease, they can cast control water, water walk and spirit guardians.

Clarissa Says
They begin a game where you must do what someone says: “Name a tree!” “Do 5 push-ups!”. There is a naming game going on as well. Here are some of the Game’s moves:
Give me your firstborn. A young man, dressed for the occasion, steps over to their side.
Make a Scene. Talk in iambic.
Show me your true face. Clarissa shifts through a thousand forms and then comes back to her original.
More and more people join in, beginning the ritual of ascension to godhood. Each player must outdo the last in a furious game of danger, keeping the words obsure will allow them to draw back from the flames, but as they speak of things like love and hate, sun and moon, the Crones may have made it through and are certainly living it up. They will start to deescalate before Tiamat comes through. The players have a moment of catarsis. 
The BRH stop beating the daylights out of them.
