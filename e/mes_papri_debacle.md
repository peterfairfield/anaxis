This happened ~30 years ago, but there is still a fuss being made, and the [Bard's Libary](/l/bards_library.md.md) still has a lawsuit out against the Finders.

There also was a lot of nationalistic revisionsim going on at the same time, so the new and old cover-ups can get confused, but maybe the historical precedent can be revealing. How did they keep their secrets?

This has largely been elipsed by the [consolidation project](/t/the_moveable_library.md).

Mekilabba -- A better word?
