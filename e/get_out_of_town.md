Out of Town

-- You can check out anytime you like  

The Hole

Bore shows them the Hole on the upper lake, where they have been dropping in objects and finding that they very quickly come out in town. Message in bottles have always shown up in town, small glass tubes that have a scroll offering 10gp for the scroll and 100gp for investigating the origin of the glass tube ‘where did it come from, to the best of your knowledge?” The tubes of glass are almost indestructible, but can be broken open with a tool. There are counterfeit glass tubes, the BRH has been just spitefully playing with the data, so much so, they are starting to get into trouble with the Theatre. The Host will use this information to hire Hiram or some other spelunkers to go down the hole.


The East Standing Stones

There is a secret reservoir beneath the standing stones, there has to be scrying or digging involved from above or spelunking from the hole? The druids had a way down there, which is known to some as sacred waters. This is the drinking water of the town. 


Guarding the lake are oozes, then some Drowned, some skeletons. The temple of Scales.
