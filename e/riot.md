When in a state of riot, the city does several things:

Beef Rake or Ten Pins?
Large stone building
Looks like Bore is here too, With Hamfist, Hiram, Fallstaff, Lamark (if alive).They are working out the provisioning of the city and the various shortages or windfalls. They are talking shop, but mostly it sounds like Hamfist berating Bore for not Executing on certain things. The weather has gotten so bad and the flooding is only going to get worse and worse until the reservoirs burst. They are pretty certain of the Finders, but of the other side, not so much. Bore is going to issue a rest in place and find the leak. Fallstaff will look to the sanitation in the lower areas of the city. Hamfist the Factory, and keeping the water pots boiling. They consider public soup kitchens, and institute them in the barracks, the Iron Gate and Rock.
