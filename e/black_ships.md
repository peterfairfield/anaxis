The Boat, the Big Obvious Attacking Target.

> Dowes with massive sparless masts.

> A Ship, but of fairly recent make.

> The initial force is all raiders and fortuneseekers. Some of them even crash the bars at the city and check out the scene.

> Where it gets messy. The spiders descendant. The forest has come to you. Mangroves and palms land first

> This is just the first taste of things to come. The treants have gone through 3 evolutions and several throwbacks thrown in there for good measure. The Dendrites.
