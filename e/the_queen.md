## The Greatness of The Queen

If there is a Queen crowned in the city, it goes nuts. There are huge parades, impromptu mocking of her behavior (but in a really healthy way). The kids go bongo for the books and papers. Someone starts putting out daily broadsheets. This is like a capstone for finishing all lengths end to end, 9 or whatever through.Capstones should not be verra bad, but certainly scary to unleash. For instance, the Queen has some integral changes of government to make. More power down the chain. Fred will tear down sections of the walls, and order the other cities in their sway to do so as well. Bore will shore up every defense possible. He will start to build a fleet. Baba Yaga will get hammered at the reception and hit on the players/Bore the whole time.Vice Admiral Douglass has no nose, itâ€™s made of gold and he funds the observatory, though in a micro-managed way. He keeps tons of astrological recordings, which stars would emerge first, if they started to appear? How well he predicted the positions of the planets. There was a betting pool among the scholars, which planets would be where, and which would emerge first through the cloud. It is diminishing, and heaven and earth will be rejoined.
