Operation Werewolf:
Hamfist has lost a Mill to some occupying Tearers and wants it looked at
He can tell you about several other projects, of other Mill owners who have had similar problems. He suspects someone at the Rock. Nobody expects Option Werewolf. Mostly Hamfist wants to know: who are his enemies? Around the same time, Fat Mat drops by and mentions that his bar is full of Tearers, and he has some stuff to stash. Hamfist shoves it all down a chute and then asks Fat Mat what is going on? Fat Mat suspects some movement on the part of the Rock or the Iron Gate.

Option Werewolf
It started with him feeling his oats, then he started to follow his nose. There has been an insane screed of arrests throughout the city. He says he’s not able to sleep at night, so he has been looking into a backlist of ledger indiscrepencies. At the same time, he is making major inroads into the blood trade. No one gets past his nose, eyes and ears.

The Wreckage He Leaves in His Wake
A Lumber Mill – Forester’s Mill. He put a whole batch of Foresters in Hospital and then had them put up for corruption charges. The party, if they scratch beneath the surface, discover stockpiled weapons or perhaps direct Host involvment. Bols is sending them signals, opening them up for the party to come in and investigate, picking up the pieces. There are wizards there? Fireball.
