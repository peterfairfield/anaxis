### Corner Scholar’s Hall
(St. Andreas) 

### Dress Shoppe run by Magnus
 > During the panic/riot, this will be a nexus of messaging operations for the Society. Theatre couriers running to and fro. 
 
 > If the players need to get out of town, the Theatre can move them out in a travelling circus, or if they have to, smuggle them out through their contacts in the harbor.  
 
 >. The Theatre has some other secrets. 
 
 >. During crisis: there is a big fight here, it would be nice to have a map. Perhaps the cards are map tiles, with sigils on them. The fight should threaten the life or end the life of a close ally (Bols, for instance). 
 
 Here are some examples:
  1. Transporting Prisoners – a cart of prisoners, perhaps the town council, maybe some enemies of the city?
  2. If Ava is part of the prisoners or conflict, she can tell them about the state of the attack that is going on. There are 2 attacks, the big loud one and the quieter one. She knows more about the big loud one and its characteristics. 3. A total mistaken identity that is going to cause mayhem. 6. Everybody knows where the big attack is coming.  7. Esme Thornshield – she will help guard the helpless, if they can help her out.
