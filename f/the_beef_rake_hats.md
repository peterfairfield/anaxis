## The Beef Rake Hats

These guys actually are made of cats. Here is a taste of the agenda: kissing a hag guarding a well, make clothing and nice pretty crystals, make themselves adorable, feeding you to the ape. Some spirits have survived amoung them. And in the end, they can always eat you. They work through "Chucks" to the human world. Chucks wear the name with honor.

#### The Dashing Ones

There have been a rash of fights at the docks. A group of them were identifiable as being Dashing. They might be connected to murders in Workhall.

### The Inn
Doors say “Blood” and “Money”. They aren’t going to get out without a brawl and the Pole Bears will probably give them a fine one. Hopefully, things go well, and they manage to make friends. They will not give out any client information, but they will let them know of certain other deals that are going down in the periphery, if they actually don’t have a client involved.

There are always six guys at the bar. It is usually a masterclass. “Sometimes the war college sends their particularly pissy runts to the Beef Rake… Hats” He will finish with Hats.
