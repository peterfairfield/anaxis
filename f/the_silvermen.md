# The Silver Men
 
The Silvermen come in wooden sewn boats, made from fresh logs and hemp rope. They are looking at the sailing ships and making some interesting moves. 

Come down in a single run, a life’s run to turn wood and resin into silver and then to make it back again. 

> “I told my baby I’ll be gone till the 11th month”. 

From their basin, the river flows in the opposite direction about 1 every 30 years, down to the Silver Mountain. It's called the King Tide.

Sire Jan returns with his army, bringing Undeath Myros, and Rian, uniting the Lakoizh and throws a large party. His daughter Esme is betrothed to Emul. After some deliberation period, Jet is declared the Master of Lagash.

The Plague is travelling through the Silvermen, wiping out about a third of the population. The survivors are often those claiming Hadrad blood.

Jet declares his love for Esme. Sire Jan and Emul argue with him, as Emul is already in love with Esme, and had Sire Jan had intended for them to marry. Sire Jan denounces them all and heads for the hills to escape the plague. 

Offended by Sire Jan's self-exile, Jet counter spuns Esme and marries Undeath and crowns her Mistress of Lagash.

Rian writes some satire; some of the hardline Princes' Wolves are inspired and decide to bring down Emul and Esme. They assassinate Emul and assault Esme, but she succeeds in writing their names in blood. Rian suspects Nilfar Halfshield, and he is imprisoned by Jet.

Rian convinces Jet to ask for Sire Jan's blood, in exchange for Nilfar's freedom. Sire Jan pays the blood price. The blood is used to cure the plague, and Rian immediately begins to listen to Iorek's crazy plans, and builds Ram's Shelf. Undeath gives birth to Fred, who recieves the blood of Sir Jan's as his first food.

Eshausted, Sire Jan plans to welcome Silar into [Lagash](/l/lagash.md). Undeath proposes they send Sarl to arrange a peaceful meeting. Silar agrees and arrives. Sire Jan tells Silar and Undeath of Puzer and Abram's crimes. They kill them, messily. 

The party begins, Esme serves the pie. Sire Jan blames Undeath for the deception and near-fatally wounds her. Jet kills Sire Jan, Silar removes Jet from power, and titles himself The Erim.

Rian tries to escape with his son. Undeath returns to Namram and joins the Augurs. Silar hunts down Rian and makes him stand trial. He is imprisoned and Fred is taken to the Lighthouse. Esme becomes Warleader of the Prince's Wolves.
