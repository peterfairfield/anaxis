The Silver Mountain
The Silvermen have 
The Silvermen come in wooden sewn boats, made from fresh logs and hemp rope. They are looking at the sailing ships and making some interesting moves. Come down in a single run, a life’s run to turn wood and resin into silver and then to make it back again. “I told my baby I’ll be gone till the 11th month”. The river flows in the opposite direction about 1 every 3 years, down to the Silver Mountain.
