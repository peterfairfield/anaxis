# The Silver Men
 
The Silvermen come in wooden sewn boats, made from fresh logs and hemp rope. They are looking at the sailing ships and making some interesting moves. 

Come down in a single run, a life’s run to turn wood and resin into silver and then to make it back again.

From their basin, the river flows in the opposite direction about 1 every 30 years, down to the Silver Mountain. It's called the King Tide.

The Plague is travelling through the Silvermen, wiping out about a thrid of the population. The survivors are often those claiming Hadrad blood. Many came from old houses, beautiful marble edificies they still tend lovingly.
