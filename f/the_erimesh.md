### Niflar Halfshield

Chief in-exile of the Silvermen. Currently working as a ring-fighter pit-fighter at The Beef Rake Hats. They kinda like him, and haven’t tried to get him killed, seriously. They don’t really know his position in the Erimesh, but they know something is up with him.

If the party befriends him, he may ask them to send a message to his half brother Gloryshield.

> Everyone from Eshar think that the disruption at Tell Kur is Gloryshield, who has protested them using the mines at Tell Kur.


### [Silar Gloryshield](/p/silar)

He is willing to join up and will even begrudgingly follow orders if the Stone King arrives. He does have pressing concerns: the Empire. They’ve sent a envoy, Queen Rhesania, to visit his kingdom. She’s been buying pleasure slaves at prices that are sending the market skyrocketing. She has some bad news with her: some [assassins](/s/assassin).

#### [To the Tells](/l/tells#kur)

On the way to Gloryshield, they may encounter an assassin, and take him for a young boy. Silar has several dressing mills, and makes the best millstones. This operation has been taken over by the Empire, and they are trying to store an army of flesh golems there. This is pretty much a bloodbath, if they go into it. If they clear out the danger, Silar will send them back to his brother, telling him that the people need him. 

> He will send the Sword of the King as a gift.


Upon returning to [Eshar](/l/the_city) from Tell Kur, there will be some folks who noticed them at the BRH – maybe the New in Towns? One of them disguises/transforms themselves into Niflar in order to collect the treasure/adze. The players may notice that it is a fake, but they may not. If not, Niflar may be dead and replaced by a doppelganger.

#### Esme Thornshield 
sees Lagash as the future of the Silvermen, and she has a plan to make that happen. The caravans must run, no matter what comes.


The Wolves Under Attack
Someone (probably the Host) tries to burn the town down. There are 5 different challenges, which Tzagim should know about. Esme Thornshield owns a small town that was destroyed, while the materials to destroy the East Reservoir (Tell Iona and Tell Kur are the two ruin-mounds skirting the reservoir).
