# The Danoi

## There are three principle types amoung them:

> ### The Boatwights: 
> bright eyed and haired, they have travelled down the Cedar river and 
> Have a lot to teach about ocean-going craft.
    
> ## The Pirates
>  These come in spots and stripes. All in with the Boatwights and the Defenders
>  They are present in any non-singular group of Defenders or Wights. 

> ## The Defenders
> They have a problem in leadership. The young king has become drunken and dangerous. He is liable to be leathal. He is [Belesys](/p/belesys)
> If the shipworks were moved to the end of the lake, and reedboats made with wood frames, a deal with the Danoi can be reached through Belesys. Otherwise, the same deal with work with Lesure or with Inajon if they are able to remove Belesys.
