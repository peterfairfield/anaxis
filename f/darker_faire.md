## Darker Faire  

They might be on the streets, or down by the lake, as the Faire does know about the history of the town. They are happy to let the Host discover and build defenses to deal with an outside threat, but they are beginning to suspect that something else is up. They will want to reseed false data back to the Host about the tags.

1.  Bags of tags. They re hired to trade tags for tags. The tags are all sorted and stacked. They meet and exchange bags with other bagment (all of whom end up dead because they gave the tags to the wrong people.) Somehow set them up all fancy to look like they are War College students or some such?
    
2.  If Bore catches them, he’s likely to overlook the real confusion (that the tags are being mesesed with) because he’s so excited to get the players to work for him.
    
3.  Someone legit wants to buy something dangerous like nitric acid (for making guncotton). They will test the nitric acid by dissolving copper in it. Very concentrated nitric acid will fume when air is blown on it and will not dissolve copper until it is diluted.
    

The Opera is being replaced with more Host-friendly content managers. This will not stand.
