# The Blood Empires

 **The Orcs**

### The Burning Banner
 – King Pyre – The Masque has given them enough information to embolden them to strike at the headwaters of the Silver River. They have recently taken the [Silver Mountain](/l/the_silver_mountain) itself. They start with large amounts of light infantry, and then strike teams to take care of hardpoints.

### The Crimson Trinity

They wish for battle, and a lot of death. Their first meeting will involve a maximum casualty event. 

> The [Green](/f/green) want a member of theirs out of the Empire.

> The [BRH](/f/the_beef_rake_hats) want to smuge a prisoner on the nose.

### Eschar

[Lord Saxon](/p/lord_saxon) is already planning for the launch, but for his own reasons. He wants to pull the legions together locally to deliver more provinces to the Sea Peoples, and in general more autonomy to the outer provinces. He is doing so for the longevity of the Fleet Launches. He is also spending a ton arming the army. He likes nothing better than a bunch of buttered hoplites sparing in a chalk arena.


### A Compromise Over Text
  
Lord Saxon will be involved in the Mes papri debacle. The Edos will ask for a seat at the table (A college and a seat in the University). Bolsingers elevated? Who will they elect? Parson. What is the exchange exactly? Obel may be exposed as an empire agent in this series of events, he may want to get a hold on the Mes. This will change Orcish society almost instantly. Which copy of the text will they recieve, the one written by the Finders or the one written by the Stigians? Bolsingers will hear enough about the new publications, and who is funding them (the Empire) to start to become worried about it. Their Edos will report to the Aunts and then all hell will break loose. 
 * [Aunt Elisa](/p/aunt_elsela) goes for the presses
 * [Aunt Agnus](/p/aunt_agnus) goes for the papri. She will also waylay the first shipment out.
 * [Fallstaff](/p/fallstaff) will go nuts and start up a mad science project and infiltrates the presses. 

Bolsingers College of the Mind will be elevated, and the texts of the Edo will be taken into the Mes, as primary texts. So, perhaps some of the books had been stolen, not modified? The Edos have no need to launch their attack on the presses.

Destroy the Mes – back down from their attack. The Edos should have something to offer.
