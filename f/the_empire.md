  

The Orcs

The Burning Banner – King Pyre – The Masque has given them enough information to embolden them to strike at the headwaters of the Silver River. They start with large amounts of light infantry, and then strike teams to take care of hardpoints.

  

Lord Saxon is already planning for the launch, but for his own reasons. He wants to pull the legions together locally to deliver more provinces to the Sea Peoples. He is doing so for whatever excuse he can. He is also spending a ton arming the army. He likes nothing better than a bunch of buttered hoplites sparing in a chalk arena.

  

Lord Saxon will be involved in the Mes papri debacle. The Edos will ask for a seat at the table (A college and a seat in the University). Bolsingers elevated? Who will they elect? Parson. What is the exchange exactly?

  

Allow the Mes to be distributed – a seat at the table (seems exploitative)

Destroy the Mes – back down from their attack. The Edos should have something to offer.
