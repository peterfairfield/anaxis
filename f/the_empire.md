# The Blood Empires

 **The Orcs**

### The Burning Banner
 – King Pyre – The Masque has given them enough information to embolden them to strike at the headwaters of the Silver River. They have recently taken the [Silver Mountain](/l/the_silver_mountain.md) itself. They start with large amounts of light infantry, and then strike teams to take care of hardpoints.

### The Crimson Trinity

They wish for battle, and a lot of death. Their first meeting will involve a maximum casualty event. They want to take the two rivers back, hard.

> The [Green](/f/green.md) want a member of theirs out of the Empire.

> The [BRH](/f/the_beef_rake_hats.md) want to smuge a prisoner on the nose.

### Altir

The capital of the Hadrad Empire. "The place of Scribes".

Here they are recording the issues at hand: who is responsible for the plague? This only occurs in areas close to the rivers, whenever troops go down into those river basins, they get sick and die. The Empire have found out who the Aunts are and are targetting them one by one, starting with Aunt Agnatha. In the likelyhood that she goes down, she will convey her final drop to them, and bids them good luck!

While the Aunts are under attack, someone might figure out that the problem isn't the Aunts, but the Empire that is guiding the strikes. Maybe nobody gets hurt, but the Aunts? Not likely either.

The House -- a house (sal) tree. 

### The Hadrad
When the swamps beneath the sea became flooded with salt the black dragons could no longer find a place to spawn, and so they remained in pupa form, until the day when they might find a way to reopen the swamps. Hence Lord Saxon's sea wall. 

## Reds (Golds)

The Reds have been ruling from the front for a long time. Sagimah Pyre is the warleader of the Alamite army.

## Blacks (Copper)

The first to fall, these were the first Hadrad. The Emporer was amoung the first blacks to feel the wanderlust. See [King Solen](/p/king_solen.md).

## Blue (Bronze)

The Problem with Blue.

## Greens (Brass)

By far the most common Hadrad, they often serve as bodyguards, captains, or elite warriors.

## Whites (Silver)

The fewest of these have come over, and rumors of ancient white dragons still abound. Their plan is to use the Kracken to summon the winter? Or perhaps they have a spell they are working on that needs to be tweaked a little by the intervention of the players, to exlude the delta itself. They are going to redirect away the stream, and bring the cold back to stop the rising of the waters.

This has been going on for almost a hundred years now and the people of Eschar are no longer sleeping on their roofs. The Kraken has taken notice of this change and their is a clash of temperature, which perhaps the reds can mitigate, by limiting the winter. This will stop the water in its tracks. They might have to wait a little and get some year or decade turns :_)

## Lizuizos 
The raven -- perhaps this is Parson in.

He tells them that the Enclave and Emporer are planning to set off the three sons and Darva mountain at the same time. This plan will already be preempted by King Pyre, but that their plans involve an infiltration of greens and the breaking of the contract. They plan to bring on a winter that will make the entire plain recede and bring back the land to how it was. This is basically impossible, but the Emporer is also desperate now, and he might just do it to stay and reclaim his land.

This plan will also be catastropic for the ravens. They will be forced into the sea, which has no end. He hints at knowning about the moon, but largely he seems concerned about his family and the fact that they are going to be sacrificed.

The freezing rain begins instantly, after the mountain goes off.

## The Hunt for the Black Emporer

Quickly the hunters become the hunted. The least likely of enemies hits them. There are stayers amoung some of the parties of Eschar. Bore in particular a joiner and stayer, so he might be hitting with an assassination strike as well, but depending on tensions with the Executor they may be able to avoid a fight, depending on how they are dressed. Then the wolves jump them!!!

## This will certainly kill everyone

This fight is stupid impossible to figure out. The most confusing switches happen. Someone probably stabs themselves, in the neck or something. No one really knows what is going on but the raven, who will at least let everyone know where the target is, maybe not realizing the the old cuckold wolves are beyond help.

## Outrunning Wolves

This is a really good idea, in theory. There is the entire 15 elders, even the missing 4 is there. They have a chance to change the target of 3 of them? If they made contact when they met during the coronation, then they have a chance of turning all but the core 7. They may quickly have a majority, so they'd like to see as little killing as possible, as they have a long future ahead of them if they pull this off. Wolves in the hills, wolves in the snow, happy as pups, snuffling about the woods, dark and green. Of course, helping the wolves and making sure that everyone stays dead, are the 34 loyal white half-dragons. An entire fucking army of these things. They are mostly wizards, mostly stupid powerful, and hosebeasts of doom. They wish to swim in the frozen waters of the bay.

Perhaps the blood-magic shown in the combat is a forwarning of what the rest of the council is capabale of.

## The Sacrifice

The Whites are going out with a bang. They are taking the final drops of the emporer's blood and mixing it with terf. It is congealing into a worming mass and all hell is breaking loose. The 3rd round the sacrifice goes off. Depending on how much stuff they can cut off the mass, they are able to impact the coming storm. They will have to show some restraint to halt the waters, Aunt Agnus will gently then not-so-gently nudge. The Emporer will try to help them by shouting out what is happening to him. The poximity of the body, but the alieness of the swamp earth. He will partially form into a psuedodragon. The Black Emporer. He will be devoted to Aunt Agnus and Undeth if they ever meet. He'll let her know how the assassination attempts went. Mostly they got him, and then he didn't die. And it was really painful while it happened, and once he lost all his hair. He really wants his catch-phrase to be "Sleep!". He is a font of information, and if there is a military, he's probably served in it and knows their commanders status and foibles. 

## Raven intel

Before they have to hit the 34, the raven can tell them this:
 + They can take them by a secret way into the fortress they have moved into. 
 + This is facilitated by their spider friends (this is Parson watching Aunt Agnus work)
 + If they mess things up, there is still a good way out.
 + So, we take them in 2 or 3 days. They have no resupply, and no reinforcements. He apparently doesn't understand what is about to happen, only that they need to end a problem. Then he remembers his family and urges all haste.


## The 34

These guys are a piece of work. Let's do 34 stat blocks now:






So this was Shawan Fillstorm's plan. Have all of the dragons hatch at the same time and go off to wreck the enemy. She's maybe misjudged the chaos that would ensue. The Dwarfs don't mind killing Dragons, and then there's all those tasty cows. She also knew about how pupa can effect each other. The most worthless elements won't be in a positions to get to the birthing grounds. How does she establish this largely nul-sec no-go-zone of his family's lands. This becomes a neutral ground zone, known as the Flint House. You can tell when you come into the place. No blow has been struck in anger in this room. The walls are made of stone. Three hexjoined pillars of basalt, 60 ft on a side, it has a wide open room and a long bar at the end.

The barmaid will explain: "What's in a word, anyways. I'd imagine that at some point, they sold flint. Then after he left, they missed so bad they called it "Flint's House" and then.... Now we sell beer! Would you like some?"

The Hunt: this should widen the mystery: Who are their adversaries? They should have a pretty clear, I mean really clear picture of that by the time the Moon arrives. Let's have visits to the other side, islands coming in and out. These descent-into-hell meat-grinder dungeons just lurking in the offing? Thar be monsters here.

In this place, the deals that seal the fate of the King are agreed upon:
 * The Mes and how they should be spread. Freedom is the core. Jid is the truth. The Kraken is allowed to come along, if it can keep it's pants on.
 * 

### Eschar

[Lord Saxon](/p/lord_saxon.md) is already planning for the launch, but for his own reasons. He wants to pull the legions together locally to deliver more provinces to the Sea Peoples, and in general more autonomy to the outer provinces. He is doing so for the longevity of the Fleet Launches. He is also spending a ton arming the army. He likes nothing better than a bunch of buttered hoplites sparing in a chalk arena.


### A Compromise Over Text
  
Lord Saxon will be involved in the Mes papri debacle. The Edos will ask for a seat at the table (A college and a seat in the University). Bolsingers elevated? Who will they elect? Parson. What is the exchange exactly? Obel may be exposed as an empire agent in this series of events, he may want to get a hold on the Mes. This will change Orcish society almost instantly. Which copy of the text will they recieve, the one written by the Finders or the one written by the Stigians? Bolsingers will hear enough about the new publications, and who is funding them (the Empire) to start to become worried about it. Their Edos will report to the Aunts and then all hell will break loose. 
 * [Aunt Elisa](/p/aunt_elsela.md) goes for the presses
 * [Aunt Agnus](/p/aunt_agnus.md) goes for the papri. She will also waylay the first shipment out.
 * [Fallstaff](/p/fallstaff.md) will go nuts and start up a mad science project and infiltrates the presses. 

> **Fallout on the Empire**: The Mes will spread through The Empire, transforming it into a cultural vassal state.
> The Corrupted Mes will transform them into a beligerant enemy, to harry them or worse, they fall Thrall to Aunt Agatha, or whomever is modifying the Mes.

Bolsingers College of the Mind will be elevated, and the texts of the Edo will be taken into the Mes, as primary texts. So, perhaps some of the books had been stolen, not modified? The Edos have no need to launch their attack on the presses.

Destroy the Mes – back down from their attack. The Edos should have something to offer.
