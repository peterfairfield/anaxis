# The Death Bunnies

## No matter where you are
**The Death Bunnies are there**

 &gt; I wonder


In the event of their body-deaths they have a contract that they will share all of their memories once they've transfered to another network. This contract, once entered into gathers them to a strange time of memory counterintelligence on their part. Who is trying to peer into whose memories? Who is peeing in the pool? Who is the traitor?

Who wants this witness eliminated? Who wanted them to witness this in the first place? Who was there to prevent him from witnessing it in the first place?
