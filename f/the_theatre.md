## The Stolen Texts Timeline

They have had one of their most precious works stolen, the originals of some of their oldest plays. In particular the Defense of The Flint House & the exploits of Harn the Hammer.

They work principly for the Host, but they have no priciples. Sometimes they make money selling seats.
