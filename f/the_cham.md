# Cham

The Lake People, The Cham, Champoi, the Lakoizh

These are the first inhabitants, before the Danoi Finders and the Sea People. They have simultaneously adopted the Elven system of government, while keeping enough pressure and threat of rebellion on them to require a large military presence. 

Lakash, Eshar of the Sands, Losh, and Halfwall are their principal cities. They are related to the Danoi in language, but their culture has been swept up in a fascination with the Rashesh.
