# Boatwights
 + Wights

 ## Travelling to Cedar Mountain

 There are some encounters that would frame the wights for the players:

 ### Defenders

 They are accostted -- or allied in battle --  by an incredibly well-horsed group of savages. Some of them are fairly hotheaded, but there are cooler heads amoung them: [Belesys](/p/belesys.md). Unless they are aquainted with the court, they will not likely recognise him. He will tell them that the boatwights are not to be bothered just now, something has them riled, and they control these forests and the hills above them.

 Our mapping sense is heirarcichal, as in I map my house differently then I map the outdoors, or even the road to Harrisonburg vs. Harrisonburg. 
 
 These are here to for two things; make love, sell horses, and the players are welcome to buy some absolutely ridiculous horseflesh from them.

 ### Pirates

 They will simply demand a forest tax and let them go their merry way. If they are opposed, they will count heads and go for it. #tag #partyFight. They have a lot of shells, flowers and feathers on them.

 ### Burial Scene

 The Cutha is strong in this area, and there will be nights with rites.

 ## The Village

 ### The Boar Hunt

 The wight scouts are hunting for boar as per keeping their posts. They have flushed onto the party if they are sneaking, or just bump into them with boar in the area. It might be funnier to have the awkard meeting, and then the bonding fight happen afterward? 

 > Don't tell a snotty-nosed kid that he'll get a special bow out of this, tell him that the bows are not for sale.

 The bows of the bowrights are tremondous. Laquered wood and hemp string. 

 If the players have been easily spotted by an outer scout, they have animal messaged ahead of this party, and they are largely welcoming and meet in a nice place for meeting, like a clearing.

 If they've snuck in well, then they might have to counter-hunt to find them. Largely they are there to welcome them to town, and are dressed as stick dancers. They do have nice bows and will be shooting arrows like they cost nothing. Turns out they are just rich.

Evening light. Everyone dressed in bright spring covers. They build with stone and beams. Their houses are small, tight and cozy. 

They are brought to a long stone and timbre barn that is currently serving as a mustering stables.

There they meet Elissa Heron, bathing horses. She is the Stablemaster, as the Garrison Commander has recently fallen to assassins. Daniel, the huntsman, will take his place at her right hand and sit.

Elissa is in full armor. She is very happy to see them and asks for the journals of the wights they met off the caldera.

She will give them a brevia of the situation and then tell them the truth about what is really going on.

The Boatwights are of two branches, the more piratical and the more funerial. An odd choice, but the piratical wants to make a run for it and start building boats again. The Deathwights may not want to let them go so easily. They are headed in to wipe the cutha out before they control the harbor. 

They have 10 hours of mobilization left before they leave. Then they ride through the forest roads. They travel all day and make their way into an already prepared encampment at dusk. They have tables at hot food ready. There are several wights in gleaming armor. They meet several of the other leaders: Hamshiel, Jesriel, brothers of Daniel and Nashlelu. They just got there that morning. Dinner is turnips and carrots. The soup is well seasoned and there is bread.

They are going to attack the centre of Lagash and take the harbor, allowing the Eshar navy controll of Lagash. There is the lighthouse, which someone needs to take out.

Nashlelu has been in the harbor and there are patrols of Lagash throughout the harbor. It seems like they are not prepared for a large-scale attack. Any help getting inside the city or taking out the lighthouse is welcome.

Nashlelu also tells them about the other things she's been seeing in the harbor...

The things...#tag #tobecontinued

They have travelled to Lagash

### Slave Harbor

This place is strung with lights and run cleanly. The Hung Jury and the Chance Meeting are the only two ships in port, along with several smaller fishing boats.

Once inside and under siege they can run into:
 > Bands of Meetings #skirmishers #rogues dancing lights, darkness, faerie fire

 > Fact-finding mission of Jurists -- these only engage at range and retreat when forced into melee. They will focus fire and move to higher ground. Darkness, dancing lights, rapiers and crossbows. Their bolts are nasty somehow.

 > Harbor Master #hosebeast fireball acid arrow blur magic missle protection haste scroll

 > Captain Muss or Captain Keith #battlecleric net and hook, hold person, sound burst, protection, healing
 
 The lighthouse is a library

L shaped building, forming the NE corner of the harbor. Watchtower and harbor light. 
 > Snipers on the roof, these are Lagash Regular troops, and are not specced for shooting, but can really pack a wallup.
 > Spiders in the hall, More heavily armed Regulars. They will not stick around if they are taking punishment, however.
 > Demons in the basement The pleasure houses of the harbor masters. Use dretch stats for the masters but if the masters can get ahold of their stuff they can start tossing fireballs or worse.
 > There is a small final guard of Meetings in the Stacks and the Gatehouses. 

 Once they've secured a Gatehouse, the assault begins, and they can secure more entrances or they can get swept up into the harbor disaster.

 The remaining captains and masters have mustered around the Hung Jury and are making a last escape attempt.

 Master Paragon in particular has some surprises for them, 
  * confusion, charm person, hideous laughter
  * some High Danoi mercs. 
  
## Daniel gets nabbed
 
 Daniel had been on the first charge, and began a circle-run of the harbor. He quickly discovered about the mangonels on the Gatehouse and on the three spars out into the harbor. He is currently trying to take the first of these, but coming from fire from the warships as well as the other two wooden towers. He is likely taken before the players can get there, unless they stick to him very closely.

 Keeping Daniel alive will involve taking the mangonel towers before the ships.

 Then onto the main fight for the ships, which can go in several different ways:

 ## Taking the Chance Meeting

 If they do persue, they get the full brunt of the Chance Meetings in the face. Ranged enough to get you to close with them, deadly when you close. 1 archanist, 4 skirmishers, 2 marines. Sundry enslaved creatures.

## Assaulting the Hung Jury

Use Flesh golems & piles of zombies for brutes and the crew on ranged. They will abandon ship once the meat-shields are down.

Further down into the holds, they will find a vrock and research into the Finders, perhaps a note about the Ymil, or the [Stigian Society](/f/the_stigian_society.md) itself. Equipment for raising Zombies. There are diagrams of the moon, with some hazing or clouds. Markings of the moon are clearly drawn.

A desk full of spell components and someone missing?
### [Beruni](/p/beruni.md)

Imprisoned in the hold is also the tortured Nain. He is experiencing soulwarp and is largely acting like a baby. He is still interested in opening up their skulls and having a slurp around. If his enslaves fail to land or he is discouraged properly, they can probably get him established in the harbor. Beruni also knows about the harbor defenses -- and something about the Nova Helios.

### The Lagash Gate

They will finally face a Ramesh opponent. I'd do a CR 10 Barbarian, and make him have a lot of early edition immunities. Maybe warblade abilities? This is a third-generation Finder, an Imperial Guard, he wears the Red.

Once they secure the Finder, they should trigger a signal that [Admiral Lesure](/p/lesure.md) will begin the attack on the Harbor. Or he may attack prematurely and trigger some nasty combat with Edo Beruni. Ships! Intrigue! Disaster!

The harbor begins to shift into and out of timelines, as Beruni spawns or rejoins the harbor. You might notice him helping the party by choosing timelines where they don't get hurt, giving them inspiration is one option here. Spells are harder to resist. 

### Taking the Harbor

The Garrison shows up in force and needs to be held.

The Waves -- The Finder Palace that glares back at Lagash. The Wave Finders went there to settle an alternative to The City. They allowed free trade and now the Wolves of the Silver Mountains have taken over most operations. The slave trade has recently in the last three years begun to dominate most commerce in the city and the Finders have found no viable ways to curb it, so many have skirted the issue, living as pirate kings, preying on slavers.

They also keep a watch out for the black ships. Most other Finders have taken the islands beyond and hold them in the Commonsea. The pirate kings of Lagash are hated but respected by the Eshar pirates. The blood between the old Finders and the Lagash ones can get really bad, so Lagash has kept it's distance, and holed up in its harbor.

The Finders that remain have an insane idea: let the slaves out of the city during the attack. He's opened all the waterways, set fat bundles of sticks everywhere (to protect from sappers and machines). He has counter-sapping teams laid out all over everywhere. Still, when he sees them this close to the Lagash Gate, where you get pinto timehop, he will likely snap and try to crush them.

The rest of the siege is a desperate attempt at fleeing on the part of most of the Finders, with the exception of the Garrison commanders, who are fielding several teams of rogue/assassin teams. The assassins are shape changers and can even vanish. Faerie fire, obscuring mist darkness, spider climb and lots of back stab.

There are also some teams of counter-sappers who use smoke and greek fire. They fight with skill and zeal; they know that things aren't going to be pleasant for them in Lagash until the [Wolves](/f/the_erimesh.md) return to regain control.

Once they besiege the palace, they begin to encounter the Erimesh in force. Notable amoung their number might be Esme, and some of the Enclave. 

> Map of the Palace of Slaves

Some demon stats for the guards, or perhaps throw in something more thematic of what happens to Finders when they go bad.

Big Fight

The big fight is both inside and outside the palace.

The PCs need to get inside, find the Finders and do something about them, unnoticed. The Finders will attempt to stop them, using their counter-sappers, their shape changers, assassins, and their own considerable skills. They also have a few fire-based monsters.

They get inside and can't find the Finders until they find the "Last Stand" room.

The PCs might have to fight the Garrison and the counter-sappers to get in.

The PCs encounter the Erimesh in here. If they kill any of the Erimesh, they are in for it, even if they are outside the room. The Erimesh have a lot of powers to detect anyone outside the room, so they are going to find them.

The Place

The place is a palace, but it is also a fortress. The outside is covered by a strange substance that can turn your stuff to stone. The inside is a maze of switches and stone. Everything is stone.

The Finders are inside. They will do anything to keep their secrets and to keep the PCs from getting at them.

# The Bad Finder

~10th level shadow evoker. What is he doing here? #TBD

~10th level antipaladin is here, defending the evoker according to his contract. He will try to frighten them, using words of the Leviathan (fight a [hagfish](/stats/bohle.md)), and if that doesn't work, he draws his sword and gets to it.

## Boatwights II -- The Trial

### Discovery of Ancient Weapons

There are some old weapons left over by the Empire, still used in the houses once belonging to the royal houses of the old Empire. Many of these weapons are now defunct, and used as objects of interest or in a more utilitarian way. Two aspiring new lights in Eshar are attempting to steal one of these from
