## Givers of the Green

They believe in purging everything about the other side and its nature. They have dealt with invasion after invasion of disease and death, all coming from the other side, all of its effects. All of its systems are rearing to go to oppose the other side. They maintain the brain caches for the Society. 

They can preserve the remains of the ancients in urns that when supplied with batteries, can allow you to extract information from the urns.
