  

The Finders

The first of the Sea Peoples, they once ruled the city, but have recently been in decline, to the point of becoming slumlords.The Finders are also there on a CYOA operation, or rather, they want to know who did it. Steal the really important book. Now everyone in town is stealing books. There is a book stealing nightmare coming. Then the burning begins, once the Game has started.


The Finders Pact

There was an original pact between the Finders and the Champoi people. This was shelter and reverence for knowledge. The Finders built a system of administration and the dispensation of arm ies and the creation of infrastructure. They rolled out conscription and the recruitment of criminals and the conquering and integration of other groups. Champari was the language that contributed the most to Common, and they are interchangeable.

The Fall of the Finders

As the power of the city began to be administered through the Colleges, the Finders found themselves pushed to the older, less desirable quarters. They remained as an important element in Eshar: founding the Fringe College’s, including their own elite Finder’s College. They found it difficult to integrate with the upper crust of Danoi and the Erimesh, remaining a subgroup of the Champoi. They have always held the coastal areas, but there power has moved into the shadows as they have moved into a period of waiting, watching the moon and the stars for movement.
