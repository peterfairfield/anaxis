  

The Finders

The first of the Sea Peoples, they once ruled the city, but have recently been in decline, to the point of becoming slumlords.The Finders are also there on a CYOA operation, or rather, they want to know who did it. Steal the really important book. Now everyone in town is stealing books. There is a book stealing nightmare coming. Then the burning begins, once the Game has started.


The Finders Pact

There was an original pact between the Finders and the Champoi people. This was shelter and reverence for knowledge. The Finders built a system of administration and the dispensation of arm ies and the creation of infrastructure. They rolled out conscription and the recruitment of criminals and the conquering and integration of other groups. Champari was the language that contributed the most to Common, and they are interchangeable.

## ***The Fall of the Finders***

> Synopsis: 

> As the power of the city began to be administered through the Colleges, the Finders found themselves pushed to the older, less desirable quarters. They remained as an important element in Eshar: founding the Fringe College’s, including their own elite Finder’s College. They found it difficult to integrate with the upper crust of Danoi and the Erimesh, remaining a subgroup of the Champoi. They have always held the coastal areas, but there power has moved into the shadows as they have moved into a period of waiting, watching the moon and the stars for movement. 

### The Play

#NOTABENE:A typical module railboxes you into a specific path, I'm trying to give you a suggested path, but along that way, provide post-scripts like: if someone smashes the plates; then this happens, if someone grabs the butter, then they get butter-grabbing skills. On curses: most of them should be positive but grayish curses, some should just be curses.


### Sorta plota: Cast should be players + 1 finders.

The some heroic Finders, of various lineage were attempting to infiltrate the Castle of Narses. The play they were meant to play this completely ridiculously epic piece of theatre, from the early days of the Finders. They begin rehearsing the play. The Trial of Babbi Fran came back home from a long successfull career on the sea to visit Lagash one more time, to check in on an old friend. He initially suspects those close to her of feeding off her kindness, but finds that in the companions, she has found solace as well. He lays her to rest in the Kirkhalls, with all circumstance pompipable. The companions follow and he takes them to the Wall, a prison where a friend of his was held. The Edo Nain has been kept well, but is suffering from withdrawl of some kind and a mindsickness, which eventually leaves him catatonic. Babbi revivies him and calls for help, but the Silvermen are amuck in the streets. Someone has let the Lion General Narxas. While the Erimesh in the long beards and iron swords defended against the first non-Hadrad leader of a Hadrad legion. 

They flee together through the chaos, they first run into some other refugees, who are going back to the Hadrad controlled areas, then they run into some bandits with a lot of Hadrad loot. Negociations can go either way.

NOTABENE: to go for these deeper side routes, like "we play the bandits" or "we play the heroes" will be stated out #TBD Also, when they make a check against Naxas, always give them the ability to catch that he's hiding something; he's caught in mid-shady bahavior himself. Or perhpas he stole one of their ships, who knows? In any case, it should be hard to notice his eyes.

They arrive back together, where all hell is really breaking loose on the outside world.

He refinds his friends, just as they are about to do the play. Babbi Fran appeals to the finders, and they listen to his words. The finders decide to help Babbi Fran find where the 

Nain

Try to keep from breaking character, or just cover well with humor. It might be fun to break back out one layer whenever someone breaks character, this might be best if they are in the middle of combat or just plain forgot where they were and who they were playing. Try to get them to tell a story about something that happened to them in real life. Then start making dice roles. Once they pass from those zones which have more delight than the pausity I wish to put before you #NOTEBENE


The Scion

She was second daughter of King Mammon. She tried to kill the man who took her father down, killed a lot of people and then wound up in Prison.

The Souless Seeker

Raised a child of abuse and rape, he derives his humanity from someone close to him, and protects them to save himself from falling.

The Mother Hen

He always takes care of his crew, does the little things. When he doesn't have his crew he searches for his lost children. Without them, he drinks.

The False Prophet

He is able to win all the people to his side. His writings are read widely, and published out of the Kirkhalls. When he is slighted, he responds like a viper. If he is threathened (in his weird way) he will lash out, but become forgiving and consilitory
