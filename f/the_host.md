 * Someone from the Theatre? Obel’s boss, Magnus?
 * Tearers 
   * There are several crack bounty hunting groups. They include the finest assholes in the world.
 * that seems fine

#### The Host is Preparing

A large mustering of ships is taking place somewhere. An extra cohort is garrisoned and hidden in the Chippies. Executor Alain Bore has been tasked with keeping these troops hidden. The majority are actually being kept in the Necropolis, to the constant perturbation of the Moshka. This mustering is actually to prepare for an invasion of the isles, but it may begin to be diverted by the exhortations of the Sun King.

Then Came the Host.
The closest allies to hand that the Sun King had were his half-brother Dagon.

The Problems that they keep running into are the results of the Natural College’s experiments on the unnatural creatures. Their fungus, their diseases. They are now the givers of green, the living shield, and they are prepared to make some ships. Please do ignore those mistakes we left behind us, I mean the squirrel guy was hilarious, right? He always grabs the Mcguffin and runs with it no?

This makes a lot of sense of these really strange things, being capable of enslavement and vise-versa, and they are being studied by the Students of the College Mi-Go and their colors out of space. These guys are deeper into the edges of everything than they should safely be. Luckily there aren’t a ton left of them, as there was an Academic War 2 generations ago, and a larger number of professors moved out into the Fringe, Extra and Inner Colleges.

The Sword of the King
A group of St. Andreas soldiers attack the players and try to take the sword. If it is with Halfshield, then this will either occur at the Slag Pits or up at Tell Yona if he has been restored as king. Otherwise, they may have it in their possesion, if Silar gives it to them.

There are at least a dozen veterans and officers involved in this attack, and it could turn into a running battle. If they survive, Saad Khan will find them where they hole up (unless it is the bothy). He has Human Mesius with him, who will help explain about the sword. Mesius explains that the sword contains the imprisoned soul of General Narses. TMesius and Khan have a plan to communicate with Narses.
