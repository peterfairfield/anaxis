#### The Host is Preparing

A large mustering of ships is taking place somewhere. An extra cohort is garrisoned and hidden in the Chippies. Executor Alain Bore has been tasked with keeping these troops hidden. The majority are actually being kept in the Necropolis, to the constant perturbation of the Moshka. This mustering is actually to prepare for an invasion of the isles, but it may begin to be diverted by the exhortations of the Sun King.
