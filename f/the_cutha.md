# The Death Cult

The moiety of the Kirkhalls belong to the Cultha, an organization devoted to the disposal of bodies. These otherwise largely divided denominations have this enormous ecumenical interest and have shared resources and talent through the University of St. Andraes. 

## The Necropolis

By far the most common burial method in the city is the Rite of Ba. Their mouth is filled with gold, and their body is taken to the Necropolis.

# Corpse Burning

Once a quasi-illegal practice in the city, there are many types of people who still burn their bodies, in particular the woods and hill folk. Called Clinkers or Soot on the streets, they at least now enjoy as many privileges in the city as anyone. The last 30 years have been insane, entire cities built, with roadways and dykes. Many of the Cedar people and the Danoi take work in these crews. About half of them are prisoners of war, the other half slaves. These are largely burners, but there are prominemnt Danoi houses that have gathered largely in the Universities of Beowulf, having inventing the idea of ownership of land and how to record it. History was and is the heart of Beowulf.

## Danoi factions

The danoi have a great reverence for the Dead, and they practice funary rites in large, austere processions though the city. There are also public feasts frequently found in the city. Outsiders are always welcome, but the Host always retains the ability to expell you from the city, if they find it required by law. Once you're registered with Bols, you're AOK.

## The Parsons

There are many harbor, wood and hill people who deliver their bodies in the Necropolis, but again, about half of them don't, and burn on the top of Tel Iona.
