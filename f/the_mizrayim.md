### Names

The Woodsmen

## The Misrayim
They typically live outside the city, taking caravans of goods, or trading on their reed boats. They are certainly considered second-class peoples by most Esharites, but they are more often than not scapegoats.

### One Misresh stole from [Babbi Fran (Cups)](/p/babbi_fran.md)
He headed for the Hill people. Ava Gavin wants him back alive, as she doesn't think it's actually normal for them to target her. Sothis is the theif, and she has run to a pile of wild magic. She has become something strange and super magical.

### One Misresh went to Market (Coins)
And has stolen some stuff from [Roberto](/p/milano.md). He has been able to locate the gems, and found that they are in the Bogs. If they persue quickly, they come upon the deal going down. There are some rough characters involved (probably Pale Bears, or Tearers). Regardless they are targetted by life-sucking blight creatures.

### One Misresh went to Tell (Swords)
They run into Empire troops on their way, and they find the road trapped. Eventually, they may run into some actual Ubiad nobles (giants or halfdragons in scalely plate of green) They fight in a ruined courtyard, and Athothis is held captive by them. Please have lots and lots of them in a big bloody fight. Athothis will indicate that Sothis was the one who planned the heists.

### One Misresh went to Freshest Forest
This one has stolen from Fat Mat. The hounds of Bull will quickly intercept them and demand their weapons, if a patrol finds them. There is a good chance that the patrol has already been driven mad. This will be interesting, for here they meet Skyre Gowan again, but now in her native habitat. She can ask for the golden hind or somesuch for her to return Fat Mat's stuff.
