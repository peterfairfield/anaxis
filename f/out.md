“I’m a spy for the biggest, most nefarious organization you can imagine, by like 1 billion times, or some big big number. Sorry I’m babbling. You must understand, that is one damn good cover (wink).”

“Do you know who you work for. Maybe: do you know who you work for?”

“Are you insulted by the question?”

“I think we might be able to work together” Iron. Iron until 500 years ago we had iron. There is an Iron Gate to the city. We were pulling up raw nickel iron from a vein, and that built the steel of the city. But then came cheaper iron, found everywhere. Cheap iron. Anyone with cash could summon an unstoppable army, and oh look someone did. I’m working on behalf of the people who would try to make things more pleasant for everyone.”

“Speaking of which, gotta work, I’ll see you guys in my offtime, you seen like a real nice bunch, but gotta, gotta go…”

“Call me Queen, I like it!”

The choice in the city is whether to unite the reactive elements (the Ymil vs the Witches, and yes she is working for both), Bore has just been promoted to President of the War College, and the boys were feeling punchy and decided to have a Rat Hunt. Bore has court-martialed all of the middle command with extreme vigor and has replaced them from the Society. He has done this with a really old rule of the city, and is expected to be challenged in court. He is also going through a divorce with the Roma.

Meanwhile Char has applied at the bar.
 
“You found a way out! You! You did it! We are free! Look, if I ram my head into a wall, it hurts! He suffers a concussion and has to be carried. They find a cart, made for hauling  glass nearby. He wants food. Real food! I’ve got money! We can do this!”

“Oh yeah, I grabbed some things. This place is so unexpected. I’ve got to talk to someone, I wonder if they speak our language?”

“Are they even human? What are they gonna look like? Are we talkin’ fish things, rabbit peoples? We going whole hog on the “axolotls are more commonplace than we thought?” 

The Staged

They are carrying the Hierophant in a cart, he is waylaid by Hatchaxel (of the Brotherhood of the Wolf), who makes off with the satchel (which is glowing like a fucking beacon). While the ever watchful Porter makes off with the gold. Who do they pursue? Porter has the 6 bruiser who he tries to command into the fight, but who will soon back down in confusion after 1 round of battle. They are not of the brotherhood, but are Finders. First finders of resin and wood. Reed and wooden  boats, anything that will float. They will use the lighthouse to signal Hiram if Porter and/or (hopefully? staged! ) Hatchaxel escape. Hatchaxel will use the double confusion to wolf the fuck out and head down to the secret Mariner’s dock. The bruisers will tell them this if everybody backs down. Otherwise, it’s time for Bols. It’s most certainly time for Bols later, if they give chase.

Hiram
He want them to raise sails fore and aft. He explains running-rigging like this “you have to feel which way the rope doesn’t want to go and make it go.”

He then later, when the weather does a crazy turn. Square sails! Every inch up top! And take down the gaff. She likes flying straight over the ways, Keep an eye on your lines!“ And he spins the wheel, ties it to a rope around his foot and jumps to the rescue. He is clearly awesome.

Then he tosses them each a potion, while they stand in the sudden calm of the deck. All of the hands are scrambling down to war positions. As they jettison the evidence, Hiram is watching on the telescope. Hiram tells them, “Shuck over m’lads, get that strongbox and we’ll be back for ye in an hour, and stay under until you can breathe the air. Buey, rope, anchor, he tosses it at the centre of the splash. There isn’t much wind, Hiram knows that they can outsail him for a bit, but when they out of the lee of the horn, the wind will open up. He promises to be back in an hour when the potion wears off and tells him he needs every sailor aboard to handle the ship.

Down in the Depths
The line pays way way out. They are finally far enough out to meet the Kraken’s people. They have the box and merely want to talk to you about it before you go. Skum look mostly human, but they are capable of stripping down and turning into Slimefish. They are the hagfish people, and can bring a wash stream of slime twisting all around you, while their friends finish you off. Then sahaguin attack, pinging the water with electric pulses and with a stun and finish attack. They are insanely deady and only with the healing of the Slimy Druidess do they make it through, if they have left her alive.

Lamprey Salty Elisa
She can take you to your box, since she just found it. If they shot to the bottom, this takes place over the box. Once she sees them in action, she doesn’t worry too much about taking them in and thanks them for rescuing her. She realizes she can help them and gives them a lift up to the surface. “Call me Aunt Elisa”, and “Don’t stay out of the water!” She shouts gleefully. 

Aunt Elisa
Professor at Bolsigners, she follows the ships out and salvages the strongbox. She has a long slimeline with grouper on it.



The Madman: “inside this bottle is a whole other world! Look, tiny people walking around a tiny village saying hi to each other and bye mom and eat you damn food and all those nice things. If I set then down and I can get one other person to hold hands with me, and we jump down the bottle!” If someone does it, they smash the bottle, otherwise he will take the bottle back into the knapsack. He is very careful with his stuff.

The Salt Sea

The Long Sea (the Fresh Sea, the lake, the rapids). 
There are Medes in the hills and surrounding the Baynas & Campoi in the lower cultivated areas surrounding. There are several islands of note.

The Floating City
Just as advertised. Mostly sailing about the caldera.

The Grass Desert
Between the two rivers.

Monah
Town at the breaking of the waters above the lake.

Iron Road
A ridge of ruddy stone, perpendicular to the rest of the limestone.

Askha'hle
Archlich of the Society

Malak
The harbinger of the other side. A messenger from the King, perhaps?

The Silver River
The Silver Mountain
The Silvermen have 
The Silvermen come in wooden sewn boats, made from fresh logs and hemp rope. They are looking at the sailing ships and making some interesting moves. Come down in a single run, a life’s run to turn wood and resin into silver and then to make it back again. “I told my baby I’ll be gone till the 11th month”. The river flows in the opposite direction about 1 every 3 years, down to the Silver Mountain.

The Elves, Rashesh
Keepers of the seas. The bringers of bright iron, made with fires on the beach. They arrived with great treasures 100 years ago, and have instituted the system of administrations and universities to build the legions. These are usually known as the… They refer to this land as the Golden Land.

The Lake People, The Cham, Champoi
These are the first inhabitants, before the Danoi Finders and the Sea People. They have simultaneously adopted the Elven system of government, while keeping enough pressure and threat of rebellion on them to require a large military presence. Lakash, Eshar of the Sands, Losh, and Halfwall are their principal cities. They are related to the Danoi in language, but their culture has been swept up in a fascination with the Rashesh.

The Danoi, The Sea People
They founded many establishments, including Halfwall; their units are the most elite of the city’s Warbands. The Finders are the original family of Halfwall and of the Library. Their works are foundational in the University. The Finders are currently the slumlords of Ub, and some of its most revolutionary elements. They have traveled down the two rivers, bringing with them a phonetic alphabet, Urnfield culture and fine iron and finer horses.

Hill People: Baba Yaga, the Wolves, Duke Lucan, The Night Stalkers
They have the Stalkers, Karesh, and Woodmen. There are two main sects up at the East Reservoir. 


Cedar Mountain: ships, vikings, miners and shipwrights. They bring the riverboat out to the seas and find it awesome. They are intertwined with the Sea Peoples, for good or ill. 

The Wolves Under Attack
Someone (probably the Host) tries to burn the town down. There are 5 different challenges, which Tzagim should know about. Esme Thornshield owns a small town that was destroyed, while the materials to destroy the East Reservoir (Tell Iona and Tell Kur are the two ruin-mounds skirting the reservoir).

Esme Thornshield  & The Exploding Town
Warband leader of the Prince’s Wolves. Her home town exploded and there was only one survivor. She is sure the Host is behind the attacks, and sends them to the Iron Gate to see what information they can gather. Also, there was a survivor of the explosion, being held by the Moska, and she wants to spring the survivor who is kept at the Bog Dogs. 
“This won’t be boring”.

The Bog Dogs
The will have a tough time breaking in, but with some contacts and moving the right pieces, they should be able to at least get access to the survivor. Esme might come along with them in disguise. Otherwise, they are to deliver her to Esme’s estate on Sheep Island. Either way, the Sappers catch up with them.

The Siege of Sheep Island
Two words: white phosphorus fire. The Sappers light the place up and send a fireboat to shore. The Clinkers run up the beach, forcing a melee, veterans and rogues. The bring mastiffs, a ton of them. There are some ancient blooded enemies of the Thornshields, and band called Blood Gang.

The whole wood catches in fire. The attack is more than overwhelming, it obviously involves several coordinated groups, a difficult-to-put-together mismash. Someone with very deep pockets indeed. The Blood Gang is out there to kill Esme, if they rescue her, the prisoner is re-captured, otherwise, they bear the brunt of an insane amount of Tearers before they slink off.

Falstaff will arrive and tell them how they can counter-track the prisoner. This might be because he had been approached, he discloses as much as he trusts them with. But they can track the prisoner. It is a tearer stronghold, the Breighton Brothers. They will have some work cut out for them. 

Throw me in Honey
The Brothers are the most closeted bunch you’ve ever met, think Proudboys who are allowed circlejerks. You probably *have* to kill these guys. For me. If they do so, Bore will have had time to get in and out and destroy evidence. If they get done too quickly, he will send someone to show up with a group of soldiers and wipe the place. If they are really sneaky sneaky they can get some compromat on Bore.



What does compromat on Bore look like? Well, for one, he was working for the Host.

Esme – Zora Culkin
Bols 
Joanna Elb – Saj
Marius Keen – brusier for the Hospital – he wants them to find out where the drug Mull is coming from. He doesn’t want any trouble from the Tearers, so he intends to give them this information, as a gesture.
Yung will send someone to tell them of a missing person – someone’s daughter that he needs to get back in a quick and diplomatic way.

One Hot Night
Bols is throwing a cop party and will shop it by Esme or Joanna, depending on how things are going with the Erimesh. If it is Esme, everyone is talking about her losses and the slave trade.
Event: A Esharite Noblewoman is being an ass to the Erimesh and the Danoi. “Wolves from the hills” and “Flea-bitten barbarians in-exile”
Event: A man has clearly took too much Mull.
Main Event: Edo Rian is a celebrated writer/author. Sciber Meatus has gone absolutely bonkers over this guy. Edo Rian is totally innocently mindshielded. Bols will steer them clear from trouble with him/it. Lady Horne is still looking for her daughter, after that last scandal, she wants to work directly with the players and is willing to pay cash. Her daughter has been hanging out with Edo Rian and his lowlifes down at the Chippies. Another Host Prime will have a missing daughter and will want to piggyback, if there is any news to be had.

One Hot Night: The Goldsmith’s
There are two artisans working on casting a massive bronze sculpture. They have been up for 32 hours and are clearly bonkers. They are big fans of Rian’s, but they have heard that Rian lives with his parents. They’ve also heard about the rumors about the boggers.

One Hot Night: Rian’s Parents
They are wealthy, but have little knowledge of what their son actually does at the docks, but they assume he is a quartermaster, and are just disappointed he hasn’t joined the Host. They don’t know what an Edo is, but they do have just the right amount of classism to say the right things about the Savants. They will however let the players know that he frequents Ten Pins.

One Hot Night: Ten Pins
Yes Skyre Gowan Roan sells Mull, but she won’t tell them that unless she knows them, and knows they won’t sic the Hospitaller on her. Otherwise, she does know the Edos quite well, and can probably tell them more about Rian than anyone. Again, depending on how well they know each other, she can tell them that Rian has bought a new property on the w. Side of the Rock, on a very wealthy residential district called The Cliffs.

One Hot Night: Dust mephits
Rian has purchased an old Chapter House of the Tearers (perhaps one that needed some rebranding) The chapter house is decorated with twisted iron and lots of strange alcoves. There may be secret rooms with things like stuffed mermaids and lycantropes, maybe an owlbear or some forest creatures, anything that makes the players angry. Rian has hired some thugs and spy5es to provide cover for the front doors. Inside, there are several young members of the higher houses of Eshar. If they want to take these folks back, they will either have to get Rian to dismiss them, or bring them by force.

Rian has kidnapped a 

Operation Werewolf:
Hamfist has lost a Mill to some occupying Tearers and wants it looked at
He can tell you about several other projects, of other Mill owners who have had similar problems. He suspects someone at the Rock. Nobody expects Option Werewolf. Mostly Hamfist wants to know: who are his enemies? Around the same time, Fat Mat drops by and mentions that his bar is full of Tearers, and he has some stuff to stash. Hamfist shoves it all down a chute and then asks Fat Mat what is going on? Fat Mat suspects some movement on the part of the Rock or the Iron Gate.

Option Werewolf
It started with him feeling his oats, then he started to follow his nose. There has been an insane screed of arrests throughout the city. He says he’s not able to sleep at night, so he has been looking into a backlist of ledger indiscrepencies. At the same time, he is making major inroads into the blood trade. No one gets past his nose, eyes and ears.

The Wreckage He Leaves in His Wake
A Lumber Mill – Forester’s Mill. He put a whole batch of Foresters in Hospital and then had them put up for corruption charges. The party, if they scratch beneath the surface, discover stockpiled weapons or perhaps direct Host involvment. Bols is sending them signals, opening them up for the party to come in and investigate, picking up the pieces. There are wizards there? Fireball.







The Eye
An island with a single safeharbor, the beaches are the sunken ancient buildings, the sand below filled with wights. They are the keepers of the island, but if the players have the right credentials, they may let them pass. The mountain on the island, and then: a lake with another island. The descend into the saltiest salt flats in the world, and they start to see some totems. Several suns pass over, and they realize they’ve gone more than 8 miles. They are standing on salt and there is the corpse of an Iron Rose, and they descend into the Maw of the Gyre.

Joanna Elb
Lake merchant, has the most difficult position of having to work with the City and with Koinsung

Koinsung of the Long Lake
The lake can raise and fall over 16ft in a season. The stilt city, city of tusks. Several districts: Tuskharbor, Canal Lacrimose, Timocyst, Temple of Ianna.


They will allow them to communicate with the theatre, if need arises. Pools of water.

The Beef Rake Hats
Doors say “Blood” and “Money”. They aren’t going to get out without a brawl and the Pole Bears will probably give them a fine one. Hopefully, things go well, and they manage to make friends. They will not give out any client information, but they will let them know of certain other deals that are going down in the periphery, if they actually don’t have a client involved.

There are always six guys at the bar. It is usually a masterclass. “Sometimes the war college sends their particularly pissy runts to the Beef Rake… Hats” He will finish with Hats.

Tyjerere 
Once he’s warmed to them ahem, knocked them around a bit, or let Bore do it if he’s around. If Nate Hound is around, he will mention that this is a punishment, not a training excercise (he gets that plenty) but a dumping ground for War College shits, which is a total lie. He also complains that his friend, Hatchaxel, has had such a rum go of it. This is to make him look stupid.
Tyjerere will tell them about the night in question. Drake had been recruiting for the Edo in this area. He had been working on a young group of newcomers, the Bog Dogs might know them.
If the Bog Dogs were involved, things don’t look good for anybody, esp. If Fred is running with them now. They go from two dogs to three dogs at that point, see Changes of the City.


If they come looking for information on Lampry Aunt Elisa He first explains pedantically that she is a wizard. 

The Dagger, They Black and White, White and Black, The Stag, The Sun
The Ten of Chinese
If they follow up on the Dagger, they will fall afoul of the  

 The Bowl, "myriad" (万) 
The vessel of Enki, the drinking urn. The naphtha urn. When they see it, they realize it is what it is.

The Staff
These are the words written on the staves

This is maybe a good time to reveal that Obel is an incubus. His masters may go up the chain a while.

Island of the Pyramids
The pools of chaos. They will meet with Kraus, an agent of Darker Faire who has been keeping an eye on things, he will let you know that Lord Saxon is on the island, and would meet with them.

Long Room with Strange Benches.
A clerical or voting chamber, fierce hierarchy lines. Lord Saxon will have dinner in the centre and while they eat he will let them know some things they may not already know:
The Ghost Ship’s Connections.
The Natural Colleges Experiment on the Island of Pyramids.
They found a labyrinth within.
Something about the Theatre.
The Experiment has become dangerous

Whereas the Stygian’s are trying to convince them: The could be Porter or better yet, Magnus Freeman. 
There is a great evil brewing in the Pyramid. Something left from the past?
The Host will soon land and take the island. Anything we want to know about needs to be removed now!
The evil must be stemmed. – use our secret tunnel
Can you take a one-way message to contact a spy in the Host? He must come in from the cold.


Out to the Island, Captain Buckfest, or Reggie the Lame’s nephew, will ferry them cheerfully telling them stories:
The people that go to the island without it’s permission don’t live.
You can crash at his warehouse, if you want to. It’s some money if you’ve got it.
Some really really horrible take on the horrors coming out of the lake. Solidly strangely strange.
The people of the Island aren’t very friendly, if you haven’t entered their religion.
The Island is unnatural.

Once on the Island, an unrelated faction will attack them (The Rashesh?) and they will have to sort out the confusion. This is when they first encounter a chaos leak. They have rings of communication back to the Shay or Magnus. If they answer: you pour out the liquid, you see a reflection with a bird staring at you, then it flaps away to find Shay. He appears, pulling on a scarf. He might immediately contact you to the Host, or try more diplomatic channels. This is his job. Do you want him to call in the Host, at this point?

And It’s A Labyrinth!
If Char is around, he is interested in it. It’s like an archiological dig, but he has little respect for the maker. It’s just a random-dimension maze, with impossible creatures randomly appearing in every room. But, there is just a shitton of treasure. Then there is the pit trap of jelly things and the remains of the souls still lost within. Also blade traps. Every door existing the hallway. Lined with the Codicies. The Codicies are in some sort of giant ancient trap.The trap can be disabled, and they notice that it already was disabled. The Host is ahead of them, spear headed by Nate Hound and the first warpacks – a prototype hill and silver alliance, excellent at crossing rivers and cruising islands. Anyway, there is a giant wurm. Then?

What’s then is the Hounds tearing into them, not believing a word they say. If they are put down they will thank them in the morning, and probably give them a favor. If they die in the street, the Host begins to investigate them more rigorously.

Then is a big trap, a bunch of things from beyond the beyond and badies babies. The babies want to eat the minds of everything living and everything dead.

galeb duhr a – the rock itself churning beneath the chaos. The dark tower approaches. And there on the shore is the beach and the madman, writing on bits of bitumen. He is there with a Chimera. It is interested in getting out, and food, in that order. The Chimera and the Carpenter. After this encounter, the madman becomes the Carpenter, or once he has been replaced. The Chimera declares that it is no longer a Chimera and it isn’t.

Proceeding, they find Char’s lab. They whole design palace. There are wizards of the Natural College there, conducting experiments with the tools of the designer. They are like monkeys banging on typewriters. They have found out a ton of stuff in the last 4 hours or so, but now they are beginning to get worried. There is something coming through, and they aren’t going to be able to evade it. They are like rabbits caught in a room. They are both trying to repair the apparatus, and respond viciously to anyone interrupting them. One of them is Timesick for 5 seconds ago. That is sooo sick. They would really love a break, but they are all nose to the grindstone. Ah, what is going on with you?

If they don’t have the trust of the Natural College, they will be put through some tests?

Area 1 the research floor done as series of tests to prove what they are saying is true to the Natural College. If they kill these guys they get tons of information and tons of brimstone.

They are savagely attacked by Natural College Monks. If they best them, they win their respect. Seriously?

They think they are in a safe, well ordered lab. There the Host is encamped and trying to find it’s way out, Nathan is there, and probably Bore? They get wrongly jumped again? Or maybe just confusion enough to hurt? Nope! The Halfhalls have a plant! This can be He jumps to kill them, but keeps his secrets close enough. He has things to tell them that they want to keep him alive for. He knows about the blastings, and the tools used to do it. Dispel magic, etc…
The Theatre kick the tiger. This should be a main NPC death scene, I think. Obel? Would he have been able to pose as an archmage? Magnus? if he was first in the gap, he may have survived in some way? Or perhaps they have to do a little blood spilling to get it started? I’m liking Obel, for some reason.

And.. Slaad start pouring through the gate.

The Game throws a Party

They are invited along with their Rebecca Horn. The Lower Halls may send Ehren Havelin and a group to keep things from breaking out in a fight. The Theatre will also be sending Obel (Scabb) or someone like him, along with some Baleheads.

The Three Trees
Huge Ash, Oak and Elder keep watch over this ancient grove. There are processions between the trees, and gift-giving. Lots of food and drink. Rumors here will talk of the movements of the Host into certain areas, the people are disappearing in the Forest.

The Madness
Infecting the whole party. A musician playing, she has escaped from the Hole, and madness is just? A fight breaks out, probably involving the party. The group attacking are a group from outside The Game, and they back down when the madness is quelled. Lord Saxon is very happy if no-one is killed. If they talk to the muscian they find out:

Clarissa the Geiger
The fiddle is made with bone and hair. She comes from an awful place. They call it Yarash Tesh, and it is a place of deprivation of mind and will. If they know most of how to get there, she can give them a story of what life was like. The mind was ripped apart, it isn’t so much that you have less will, but that it is spread thin, throughout the grass and trees. There is a long way to go into the wood.

They are jumped by Deep Pirates. They have sticky shields and nets. They are covered in grease, they can cast control water, water walk and spirit guardians.

Clarissa Says
They begin a game where you must do what someone says: “Name a tree!” “Do 5 push-ups!”. There is a naming game going on as well. Here are some of the Game’s moves:
Give me your firstborn. A young man, dressed for the occasion, steps over to their side.
Make a Scene. Talk in iambic.
Show me your true face. Clarissa shifts through a thousand forms and then comes back to her original.
More and more people join in, beginning the ritual of ascension to godhood. Each player must outdo the last in a furious game of danger, keeping the words obsure will allow them to draw back from the flames, but as they speak of things like love and hate, sun and moon, the Crones may have made it through and are certainly living it up. They will start to deescalate before Tiamat comes through. The players have a moment of catarsis. 
The BRH stop beating the daylights out of them.


Delegation to Lagash

Characters:
Coming with them – Bore?
Edo Rian– Danoi Archeologist, the Warden of Ram’s Shelf
Iat Ulmalik – Assassin from Eshar, from the Silvermen’s nobles, but not a real item in the area yet. Bore is here to make sure he takes the throne.

Scenes:
Slave-taking and the Weavers – Ettercap stats
Gruesome mass graves, chewed by animals
A man stuck on a pole, silver knife through his heart

Ram’s Shelf
Edo Rian – closeted Skum and master of mind control and transference. He can get them deepdraft. “For the right price” “What will you give me for it?”
Bols, pleeeease Bols – emergency control during the storm. He has caught several of the beasts and put their pelts out for sale.

Roma is there, and can purr them into talking to some of the townsfolk who saw what actually happened. This appears to be:
There are some people who might be willing to talk.
Niama can tell them: “The Shrine of the Moon” and “The Bishop's Hide”
There is a really hot-headed Prince on the premises.
And he might start murdering people.
Edo Rian has been destroying evidence. Burning a lot of paper.



Eventually, Rian will have to go with the desires of his heart: the transference to werewolf without danger to his life, and loyalty to his mistress in the upcoming battle with Aunt Agnus, who is coming with her sahagin army to put the Kraken down, before it destroys the world.

The Shrine of the Moon
They meet these groups in a wild concert of violence, they might be dancing? Posturing?
Jat and his gang of Silverbloods. These are lone wolves who have long been tired of the councils and the succession. Jat will deconvene the shrine if he is put into power.
There aren’t a lot of Silverblood family here, but they are quite quick, like weasels.
The Moska who are coming to pay their respects to their great friend, the spirit of the thing that is going to kill them all.
The Broken Ones – A band of Hill people with carnival like deformities, but they become something beautiful when they shift. Half are Moska. Roma is their leader.
The New in Towns – Fresh Meat – New Demons – these are recently lead by Fred, many of them work at the Natural College.
The Spirit Itself
The Prince’s Wolves – This guy is too cool to not be a main Character. Oh, this is Vamarm Silar Gloryshield, and he just crowned himself king. Silar will say “Well shoot, I’ve dabbled in fictions no more complicated than this”

Aunt Agnus
When they meet her, she is unfortunately storming the shrine with a spider army of craboids. She is in a bad MLM and she needs a way out. She might be the only one in this scenario who can make the connection between the Kraken and the College. Agnus will move to take out what she sees as an element too close: Edo Nain. She blames him for brokering this alliance. Her primary goal is the dissolution of relationships between the Silverbloods and the University. Edo feels the same way, and they are on the lookout for each other.

The Spirit holy cow this needs to be something from Aunt Agnus’s past. What is she (Aboleth)? How did she grow up? Was it rough? She is an old brain-eater. She knows her bread and butter. Aunt Elisa eats the past. The Kraken eats stories.

Edo Nain
He will draw them back into the past, when a Danoi army stood waiting to fight for the Blood Throne. They had marched from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and they brought with them 13,000 hoplites. The mountain passes had been well repaired and there had been no-one to accost them as they crossed to the City. They faced the armies of the Hill People, he saw their determination, their might, their paths, there they fought the Hill People. 

The Garden Path
You meet Jat and Roma, arguing but ultimately agreeing to share power when the others submit. Roma doesn’t believe this lie for a second, but she is watching for this to play out.

They are met with in force by Fred and the New Pups. Things are going to get a little tense. When the party shows up, Jat make take the opportunity to accuse Roma of stabbing him in the back and attack. Or he might be talked down, if he thinks there is still time to get further public. If the Game is back on, the Primals will now hit, otherwise, it’s just Agnus’s crew, with everything she can muster off The Shudder Cudder, a newly made ancient sea folk sloop.

The reward for brokering peace and getting the succession worked out is 1 week of foreknowledge.  +1 CHA The chaos is deep and tasty.

They hoist sail, and go howling on longships after the sloop, and they are attacked by pirates.



Anosbord - Fortress of Oblivion
Fastness of the Society, built on the East of the Rock. This is almost as well guarded as the Labyrinth.

The Esharites
They are strangely attractive, but in a flawed way, they have webbed hands, strange arms or legs. The Broken Ones come from this group and many of the Moska. They are the Esharites, the people of the lake.

Long Ago There was an Eternal Man. He first lived as a warrior, then chieftain, then king. He didn’t like to stay too long in one place, even before becoming a warrior, and so as king he had regularly over exposed himself to danger. His enemies took him and imprisoned him, and he basically just vanished. He waited for his friends to miss him and return to find him, he knew that they must be on their way (if only he knew), but he realized that the time was too late, but if he could buy them time.

There were two world, when they first collided, the other world immediately attacked, with overwhelming forces. some wise magicians decided that they should borrow troops from the future in order to overwhelm the opposition

The  Censors
The upper echelons of the Editors and then the Kursers and R
They were formed to purge the evil artefacts and traps, mindless invading machines, eastereggs that eat you, etc that were left behind when they were finally repulsed, with the help of the incoming sea, lake, river and sand peoples pouring like hell for leather toward the green.

The givers of the green
They believe in purging everything about the other side and its nature. They have dealt with invasion after invasion of disease and death, all coming from the other side, all of its effects. All of its systems are rearing to go to oppose the other side.

They maintain the brain caches for the Society. They can preserve the remains of the ancients in urns that when supplied with batteries, can allow you to extract information from the urns. 

Meanwhile, on the your first invasion, you will find a peaceful countryside, and a pile of boats, and hopefully a few months provisions? I’d prefer the war to begin in earnest. What is happening on the other side is in the gyre, and is about as friendly one time as it is unwelcome another. The gyre will hire them as mercenaries in an actually really bad and bloody struggle, some middle-of-the-world evil empire scenario. What does the worst kingdom look like?
The ruler-guy is dumb.
He wants something evil badly, because he’s sad.
Therefore he has started a secret cult to infiltrate their world and try and bring him across the divide.
One side is linear and the other relationships are split second and over stuff.
He really just wants ultimate power, but doesn’t seem clear on what that means, in bed.

But how about we have the opposite of those things? This seems to be a place where the worlds are in sync. He was only found by the First Fleet when he had escaped from prison. He left some favors behind him there, and the party may have to do some insavory business to cleanup his petty messes.

Bore 
Anytime they touch him, they will be recruited by Anax Shoe – a High Tearer who works for Bore.

and the Firest Forest. He will feed them some information, and only if they make an effort.
The givers of green are healers, with the Finders, somehow
The Standing Stones are all over the Necropolis, and parts of the Chippies are built on the Standing Stones.
The criminals in the city are retrained into the legions. 
People have been disappearing. There appears to be a pattern, and the Givers of Green seem to be really implicated, if he can lead them to their own conclusions, the better.
He wants to know what the Kracken is looking for.
He wants to know anything about the Natural College he can find.

The Finders Pact
There was an original pact between the Finders and the Champoi people. This was shelter and reverence for knowledge. The Finders built a system of administration and the dispensation of arm ies and the creation of infrastructure. They rolled out conscription and the recruitment of criminals and the conquering and integration of other groups. Champari was the language that contributed the most to Common, and they are interchangeable.

The Fall of the Finders
As the power of the city began to be administered through the Colleges, the Finders found themselves pushed to the older, less desirable quarters. They remained as an important element in Eshar: founding the Fringe College’s, including their own elite Finder’s College. They found it difficult to integrate with the upper crust of Danoi and the Erimesh, remaining a subgroup of the Champoi. They have always held the coastal areas, but there power has moved into the shadows as they have moved into a period of waiting, watching the moon and the stars for movement.

The Firest has been gathering trunks in upon themselves, and twinned with spiders and nests of frogs, but the overwhelming desire is to go, to be on the move. The heart has been held too long, the worst of the groves planted by the old king to only use to build real ships. If they can find the plans to build the ships, then they will be able to get access to the old trees themselves. Depending on how the negotiations and results of the First Fleet is, if things are going poorly for the Navy, then some miracle woods might start to appear. Stuff made like wood, stained, but it breaks strangely. It also usually attracts spiders

After the outcome of the events between the Kraken and the Natural College, either this will be chitinous resin work or this comes from some independent spiders. Either way; it makes great boats. There are now spiders and ants crawling about, building things. They seem quite sociable and wholesome, if a bit strange.

Then Came the Host.
The closest allies to hand that the Sun King had were his half-brother Dagon.

The Problems that they keep running into are the results of the Natural College’s experiments on the unnatural creatures. Their fungus, their diseases. They are now the givers of green, the living shield, and they are prepared to make some ships. Please do ignore those mistakes we left behind us, I mean the squirrel guy was hilarious, right? He always grabs the Mcguffin and runs with it no?

This makes a lot of sense of these really strange things, being capable of enslavement and vise-versa, and they are being studied by the Students of the College Mi-Go and their colors out of space. These guys are deeper into the edges of everything than they should safely be. Luckily there aren’t a ton left of them, as there was an Academic War 2 generations ago, and a larger number of professors moved out into the Fringe, Extra and Inner Colleges.

The Sword of the King
A group of St. Andreas soldiers attack the players and try to take the sword. If it is with Halfshield, then this will either occur at the Slag Pits or up at Tell Yona if he has been restored as king. Otherwise, they may have it in their possesion, if Silar gives it to them.

There are at least a dozen veterans and officers involved in this attack, and it could turn into a running battle. If they survive, Saad Khan will find them where they hole up (unless it is the bothy). He has Human Mesius with him, who will help explain about the sword. Mesius explains that the sword contains the imprisoned soul of General Narses. TMesius and Khan have a plan to communicate with Narses.

General Narses
If there are near the pit, the return of Narses will trigger some tentacular action otyughs etc. Narses communicates via anepigraphic tags. They may be able to tell that these sigils are similar to those found at the House of Mushussu inTuskharbor. If they head that way, the trolldrops begin in earnest. The sigils are written primarily in ancient Eschar, but they occasionally go off in a language that is similar to Hill speak, render phonetically.
