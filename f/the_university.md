# College of the Library

A place obsessed with writing things down. 

A sheltered city within Eshar stricken by the Divorce, the heads of research, they are obsessed with the past and the “big shakers and movers” – the people who write the history. 

They honor and laud the kings of the Empire. The greater and more bombastic, like the real Assyrians, the better. Public education, wealthy family structures. They will need to see the real people and consequences. Ava will present them a perspective from her high tower.
