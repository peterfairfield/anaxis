## The Madman

Long Ago There was an Eternal Man. He first lived as a warrior, then chieftain, then king. He didnâ€™t like to stay too long in one place, even before becoming a warrior, and so as king he had regularly over exposed himself to danger. His enemies took him and imprisoned him, and he basically just vanished. He waited for his friends to miss him and return to find him, he knew that they must be on their way (if only he knew), but he realized that the time was too late, but if he could buy them time.

There were two world, when they first collided, the other world immediately attacked, with overwhelming forces. some wise magicians decided that they should borrow troops from the future in order to overwhelm the opposition
