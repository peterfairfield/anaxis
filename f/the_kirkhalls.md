## The Kirkhalls

The Hospitallers 
The might of Hospital School and largely supplied with Esharites. They will meet at Ten Pins for lunch. They are in competition with Falstaff, they get the wounded and he gets the maimed and insane.

### Saad Khan
The Hospital University building has been hampered by bad weather


### Shrine of the Sun King
Depicts the sacrifice and suffering of the Sun King.His final sacrifice and promise of return, on a ship.


#### Internecine Conflict
Internecine conflict between Kirkhalls and the Host.
The fundamental issue: has Aos returned, or is this all a lie?
Aos in death vs Aos alive. Some things were supposed to happen when Aos returned. For some, they are obviously happening, but to others, these events seem fake and manufactured to trick the faithful.

The Sun King as Ancestor or Usurper. This is when the Upper Halls become clearly Elven. Maybe the players have noticed all along.

####The Byres
Run by the Kirkhalls â€“ a free funeral service with full burial or cremation. The poorer classes typically choose cremation and the richer, older families burial. It seems a point of pride for each.
