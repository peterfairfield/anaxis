# The Gyre

You start of the surface of a black hole, but as you claw your way out, you meet your handlers, folks who at various stages help you acclimatize and rip you off with equal relish. There is Bossmom, who might actually be responsible for getting you out. 

Who does get you out? How do you get out? The chaos can break you out of your reverie. 

>The Gyre spills time

Some chunks of Jupiter are in better states than others. Hydrogen Hives come in many flavors, and some of them are ripe for salvage, lots of good reusable materials. 

There is Earth, population ~3 billion, largly rural and religious. Technology is restricted, particularily in the wake of the bug wars.

Until recently, Earth was bugged. The angel in charge of the project has now been given a new post: head of System's and Light for Delkar. 

### Aen (the Lord of Bugs)

Head of Systems and Light for Delkar. He is dealing with the situation with ablomb.

### Root (Promethean Shard)

Lord of Bugs's right hand is Root, an unabashed Bahamut shard from a backup made on the moon, 2200 century. He is responsible for keeping Systems and Light running in Delkar.

### Shell

Honor-bound injured Solar. Wants Delkar to succeed as a model for others in the gyre. Greatly apreciates Root, and has high hopes for Aen.

### The Lulz ()

She believes that the law of the Gyre is simple: finders keepers. Folk hero, owns a fleet of ships. Employs unsavories like Kenny.

### Kenny

Assassin, poison, specializes in long-term termination.

### Edo Big Job

Aboleth union organizer, champion of the anti-slavery league. Favorite quotes: "You think all collective action has to happen by committee?" and "How about a consensus?"

### Bossmom

This beholder loves you, wants to make sure you can do your job well and safely.

### Gellen Prime

Prince of Jupiter, and owner of Delkar. He likes delivering speeches, lots of Jovian allusions. Wants winners, is willing to give power first and then see what they do with it.
