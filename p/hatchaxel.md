### Kess Isand

He’ll try to use the confusion of their arrival to snatch the valuables and run it. He’ll have paid the [Ymil](/f/ymil.md) for a boat and supplies. He will deliver the books/and or gold into the boat and meet up with them on Crow Island. He can get the gold to the harbor via a the old canal. Anyone noticing this detail will have to be jumped on by [“Porter”](/p/porter.md) and convinced that he had nothing to do with it, he was just following old protocols. He will try to slip in and snatch the books if Hatchaxel can’t get them out, if he can do without blowing cover.
  
## Running down Hatchaxel

Running down with Fred. If they've gotten Fred's dingy "The Slow Clock", Hiram may pick them up on the other side of the island. [See Hunting Hatchaxel](/p/hiram.md#hunting-hatchaxel)

### The Trial
The Rat Hunt -- an annual event held by House Beowulf to ferret out the Rats of the city. This was a juballee round-up an internal housekeeping of the Tearers. During this rat hunt, a BRH member, Sorrel was goading the Tearers into indescretion and Hatchaxel showed up just when the shit hit the fan and several people ended up killed.

### They Jump Off Their Ship

> “Oi! This place looks like the sky-god sons of nurtured sons, run by a sun-god king!”  
>
> “No, look, they got paper. They have enough trees to.. To… fix the boat!”

> “Awe, they have figs too! What do these people know?”

> “They are going to die, and their city will fall, and the statue of the sky-god will decorate the prow of the boat.”

> “That was so long ago! We were kids!”

>“We didn’t even know what to do?”  
“But now!”  
“NOW!”

> “Let’s party!”

Bruce has a story for you. He has seen most everyone he grew up with die violently. He’d kinda expected to have a village, get to know his 500 people, then get kids, get a garden. Boy that sort of thinking has been out the window, for, like a long long time. He is pushing 40 and looking awesome. He wants to know if there are any girls there.

They are super friendly and highly volatile and unbearable. They try to light the sewer on fire, then they sneak into the gardens to hunt exotic animals.

They will tell you when they join the BRH they learned some upsetting things that [Bore](/p/bore.md) could use to shore up the defenses of the city. He is probably 2 steps ahead of them on most and too many steps behind on:

1.  The water situation.
    
2.  The salt situation.
    
3.  [The black ships](/e/black_ships.md) issue.
    
4.  The Silver Mountain.
    
5.  The Depths issue
    
6.  BRH private secret.
