> “Oi! This place looks like the sky-god sons of nurtured sons, run by a sun-god king!”  
>
> “No, look, they got paper. They have enough trees to.. To… fix the boat!”

> “Awe, they have figs too! What do these people know?”

> “They are going to die, and their city will fall, and the statue of the sky-god will decorate the prow of the boat.”

> “That was so long ago! We were kids!”

>“We didn’t even know what to do?”  
“But now!”  
“NOW!”

> “Let’s party!”

Bruce has a story for you. He has seen most everyone he grew up with die violently. He’d kinda expected to have a village, get to know his 500 people, then get kids, get a garden. Boy that sort of thinking has been out the window, for, like a long long time. He is pushing 40 and looking awesome. He wants to know if there are any girls there.

They are super friendly and highly volatile and unbearable. They try to light the sewer on fire, then they sneak into the gardens to hunt exotic animals.

They will tell you when they join the BRH they learned some upsetting things that Bore could use to shore up the defenses of the city. He is probably 2 steps ahead of them on most and too many steps behind on:

1.  The water situation.
    
2.  The salt situation.
    
3.  The black ships issue.
    
4.  The Silver Mountain.
    
5.  The Depths issue
    
6.  BRH private secret.
