## Josriel Gladhand of the Upper Halls  
  

### Upper Halls 


### The Holy City 

Older Commander of Upper Halls forces. Concerned with business and trade in the city. He can quickly tell when something is unusual. Factions showing up where they don’t have any business being there, the crystal vials, the new Tearer contracts. He doesn’t know about the library attacks, but he can tell them about movements of the Erimesh and the Empire. The Emperor’s name is Narsel, for instance, and he has moved very quickly in the last few years to consolidate a trade Empire and establish a route across the mountains.
