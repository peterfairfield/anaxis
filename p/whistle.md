Captain Elara Whistle

Commander of Beowulf recruits. She serves under Prince Yung and the incoming forces training. She is dragon-blooded. She will have something for them to do: clear out bandits on the Iron Road. She suggests they ride with a merchant (roberto? Perhaps Pathrusim the Misrayim) as bodyguards and take the route during this season, before the rains.

The bandits are digging for treasure and they’ve found some of it. They’ve been raiding for horses and caravans but have just sent some of their number back to town to buy more horses and weapons. Anyway, there is really an intellect devourer running the show. Gloryshield will have sent a group in as well, and they can confer with them or fight them to the death (this should be very deadly indeed).

What was the original object of the devourer? How did Parson get it? These questions need answered.
