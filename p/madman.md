  

The Madman

He wants to know about you and what you have seen. He only claims to have seen Aos, and he can't talk about it. What if it happened to you while you were talking to him, what if you suddenly realized that he was, while you were listening to him? A Messiah without a complex. The only thing to do? Do you want to kill him? I will tell you this; if you do try it, the results will be surprising. Do you want him to pretend to be nearly dangerous to his mind? Ask him what your greatest terror in the world is, he will play that thing and tempt you to look after it, like an organism that has grasped for prey again and again. To talk to them that have not only conquered worlds, but that do not want to be seen, the ones who have always left nothing of themselves behind? If they have left something behind, it most certainly is a trap. A dupe left behind to lie to them as much as possible, to tell him that he's on their side, and will ride or die! Well, let's begin the confidence game, cause this isn't my first rodeo baby! Also I have a job for you.
