### Aunt Elselaâ€™s Tower

Has been destroyed and defaced by the Lords and the Ladies, a nasty little group-for-hire and they are new in town.They have left a message: Heretic.

The scribbling on the walls are words of the Lady of the Depths, also madness and everything being eaten by the water. The Kraken is rising again (for the last time).
