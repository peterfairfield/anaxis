Three lives of Elsie

## Professor Elisa

She works in Bard's Library, and will be invaluable once they find her, +4 on most any check of anything. Also can get them discount godown etc.

> Whenever they are really in a tight spot, at least when it comes to research, she can send them a note or a book.
 
## Lamprey Salty Elisa

When Hatchaxel dumps the box in the depths, or the first time they head down even to the reff, she'll take a poke at them. She can take you to your box, since she just found it. If they shot to the bottom, this takes place over the box. Once she sees them in action, she doesn’t worry too much about taking them in and thanks them for rescuing her. She realizes she can help them and gives them a lift up to the surface. “Call me Aunt Elisa”, and “Don’t stay out of the water!” She shouts gleefully. 

## Nissa the Blue Dragon

Let them start speculating around the time they find out who Aunt Agnus is. But she's as good at playing the Edo that they shouldn't be able to sort her out passively. Her tower is a plotty mess, it really seems like the penultimate scene there was the last, or just part of a short arc.

#### [The Madman](/p/madman): 

> “inside this bottle is a whole other world! Look, tiny people walking around a tiny village saying hi to each other and bye mom and eat you damn food and all those nice things. If I set then down and I can get one other person to hold hands with me, and we jump down the bottle!” If someone does it, they smash the bottle, otherwise he will take the bottle back into the knapsack. He is very careful with his stuff.

#### The Salt Sea

Forth from the depths.

#### Aunt Elsela’s Tower

Has been destroyed and defaced by the Lords and the Ladies, a nasty little group-for-hire and they are new in town. They have left a message: Heretic. There is also a warrent out for Professor Elsela. She has been accused of denouncing the grave.

The Lair of an aboleth could be worse. There were 6 families living on the island, paid essentially to keep a really nice garden and fix things that broke. It has seen better days.

The scribbling on the walls are words of the Lady of the Depths, also madness and everything being eaten by the water. The Kraken is rising again (for the last time).

> NOTEBENE: with "Stuga" sythian then Aryan iranian, and just at that moment, I reached out my arm, palm limply upward and said "Aryan" out loud. Lightening struck, and I thought, "did I just become a white supremecist?"

Silence.

"I am white supremecist?" Then the thunder rolled, and the fiddles scraped.

#### Eel Island

They could really use some supplies, mostly facines of fuel, dung carts, and fine goods. They have a lot of eggs and milk stacking up, as well. This place has 4 large fishing boats, and is a [agricultural](/p/mushussu) powerhouse. Bolsingers uppergrads use this place to finish their projects and get a deep dive on the history of the harbor, or she will do a dramatized battle of the Pirate Kings, how they attacked and defeated 7 cities before coming to Eschar. Eschar stood with the sea, as it had always done, as the waters rose and fell of old. This is now the returning of the waters, not the rising.

The drowned temple is hardly a secret, once you're on the island, you're on top of it. There are two main entrances on the island, the huge sea caves on the north side of the island and the temple in the centre. It is underwater.
