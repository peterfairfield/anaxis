## Lamprey Salty Elisa

She can take you to your box, since she just found it. If they shot to the bottom, this takes place over the box. Once she sees them in action, she doesn’t worry too much about taking them in and thanks them for rescuing her. She realizes she can help them and gives them a lift up to the surface. “Call me Aunt Elisa”, and “Don’t stay out of the water!” She shouts gleefully. 

## Professor Elisa

Professor at Bolsigners, she follows the ships out and salvages the strongbox. She has a long slimeline with grouper on it. Hagfish.


#### [The Madman](/p/madman): 

> “inside this bottle is a whole other world! Look, tiny people walking around a tiny village saying hi to each other and bye mom and eat you damn food and all those nice things. If I set then down and I can get one other person to hold hands with me, and we jump down the bottle!” If someone does it, they smash the bottle, otherwise he will take the bottle back into the knapsack. He is very careful with his stuff.

#### The Salt Sea
Forth from the depths.

#### Aunt Elsela’s Tower

Has been destroyed and defaced by the Lords and the Ladies, a nasty little group-for-hire and they are new in town.They have left a message: Heretic.

The scribbling on the walls are words of the Lady of the Depths, also madness and everything being eaten by the water. The Kraken is rising again (for the last time).
