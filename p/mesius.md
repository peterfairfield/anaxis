Professor Human Mesius 


Warlock of the Pact A very studious man, a mediocre speaker, but he ignites audiences with his writing. His “Laws of the City” in which he points out that there are 4 systems of law in the city, and they should be applied geographically, rather than they are now. His system is widely read and referenced by Judges in the city. He is a Lich, and a Fellow of the Society, but he does have a passion for the Pact.
