The Erim

The Silvermen believe in two things, Iron and Horses. They are also taken with how well slavery works for them. They are very reasonable people otherwise, and can actually get together an army’s supply lines. They are used to building large armies and staging 3 year sieges to assault their enemies. The Orcs have long threatened them, and they look forward to using their allies to deliver them a powerful blow. This will be a good central conflict for levels 10-15. Niflar Halfshield, his half brother Silar Gloryshield is willing to join up and will even begrudgingly follow orders if the Stone King arrives. But he’s right about making an assault on the Horde. If the Sea People can be convinced to join, and if he can get Bore to let him establish a shipyard on the Long Lake, Gloryshield (Vamarm) will lead the Erim against the Orcs.

  

Lagash is a settlement the silvermen have established for themselves. Along the sea coast, riddled with ruined settlements, this one has survived the last Opening and is now establishing caravan routes between the rivers. A caravan route is also being tunneled through the mountains. Silar also has been building boats in Lagash. It has also become a huge illicit trade hub and the silvermen are fast becoming the largest slaver market on the coast. They have become too large a target to be ignored for the Orcs. They will be prepared for the Second Gift, or swept away by it, depending on whether they are able to make the changes to reconnect with Eschar. 

  

The Baynas

To the east and west of the long sea, there are 2 ancient reservoirs build long ago. They have excellent spillways and drain into the Long Sea, or can be dumped into the mountain. There have been cuts put into to increase the drainage of the Long Sea during drought, these are dangerous during spate and will need to be corrected or will flood the city.
