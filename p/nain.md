# Edo Nain
 + Beruni

Link to the past. One of long and confused memory, if memory it could be called. He tells stories. They sometimes go like this:

Pull along the strands, keep up your pulling, pullers! He has been put together can be put together again!

Whever I've been, whatever I've done. Nothing's quite like that first step back on land from the sea!

"Silver and Gold and precious here, I'm told!" -- But he's fussy, not imperial. Adem: remember he is only acting to be imperial and fussy to mask himself.

"Between the ships and the castles? I've heard you actually use gavels in Eshar, I've always wanted to see!"

#NOTABENE: this should involve taking a "negative" side of someone in a story. Nain can play the fool card, or show it to them. 

"Defense of Secrets! That's what I see here! Architecture without appeal to snake or eel!"

"I jest, my brothers, breathereens, breeeoooao. Where are we going?"

"You are bound for the Cellblocks of the Rock itself, and will stand judgement before the University!" Hiram steps in and calms the Hordle Twins from jumping him. "Edo Nain! You old scrap of leather! What are you mucking about for!"

Nain attempts to buy passage from the PCs, but Hiram insists that he escort Nain back to the rock. If they appeal they can make a check, but if they mention his debt to them for the boat, which he has probably "impounded" again... 

Naim goes aboard the stag, with the players on board. This is about a munity on board a ship.

That ship was set upon him and mutinied. He was able to make it to shore and hustled into a building along the street. From there, they were set upon by wolves of Beowulf who will take him into custody.

This is what he wants to hear from you: I understand that there exists a world in which it is possible that you trust him. Do you trust him?

They are then taken on board the ship. On board, he tells them the story of [Jefth and the Tome of Bol](/p/boaz.md)

They make it to the city, once he reaches that part of the story, they are turning him over to Beowulf guards.
