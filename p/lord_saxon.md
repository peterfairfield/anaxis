# Lord Saxon
  ***Gabriel***   
  ***The Head of Hospital School***  
  ***Master Of Ceremonies of Darker Faire***  
  ***Patron of the Theatre***

## The Protector 

The Protection of the City and the maintenance of the Legions. 

## Quartermaster

Lord Saxon Gabriel. In charge of the market place Kathkul. Saxon & his son, the miscreant [Nate Hound](/p/nate.md), and he leads the Host, but doesn't seem to mind Roma.

> The high-caste Hadrad will need to be sought out and met with, hopefully without anyone dying. They are mostly greens and reds.

## The Host

Lord Saxon is already planning for the launch. He has developed the Hospitallers and the Bulls as possible marine troops. He also wants to pull the legions together locally and deliver more autonomoy to the [Danoi](/f/danoi.md) and [Erimesh](/f/the_erimesh.md). 

He is spending most of his time arming the army. He likes nothing better than a bunch of buttered hoplites sparing in a chalk arena.

### Events

> Lord Saxon will be involved in the Mes papri debacle. The Edos will ask for a seat at the table (A college and a seat in the University). Bolsingers elevated? Who will they elect? Parson. What is the exchange exactly?

> Ava is worried that her employer, Lord Saxon, is going to use this to force her to accept security (read spies) at the Observatory.

> As they approach the crest of a hill covered in trees at night, there appears to be a hole in the foliage where the stars shine through, but as they approach, they realize it's a man in shining armor, it's Lord Saxon.

> A charcoal furnace in the forest burns with increbible heat.
