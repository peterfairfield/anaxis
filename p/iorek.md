# Iorek

Iorek conducts research for Edo Rian. He wants to experiment on people, and the plague is an exellent oppurtunity. 

## Halfshield's Blood

He has a vial of it, but it is no longer living. He has learned much from it, and has been trying to piece together a cure for the plague.

First really really corrupt Wizard they meet. He is always looking for new blood and pays a premiem for it. He has been buying Erimesh slaves and testing them for resistance to the disease. He has contracted the disease and lived, but the only slave that lived has turned out to be his bastard son.

He has been working with the Erimesh on the digsite and has been helping transcribe the language into Eshar. But something isn't fitting into the syntax.

This piece of human garbage has been buying slaves from all markets and infecting them with black. He has tried to reduce the dosage, but as it is an infection, they have all succumbed to it.
