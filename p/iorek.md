# Iorek

Iorek conducts research for Edo Rian. He wants to experiment on people, and the plague is an exellent oppurtunity. 

## Thronshield's Blood

He has a vial of it, but it is no longer living. He has learned much from it, and has been trying to piece together a cure for the plague.

First really really corrupt Wizard they meet. He is always looking for new blood and pays a premiem for it. He has been buying Erimesh slaves and testing them for resistance to the disease. He has contracted the disease and lived, but the only slave that lived has turned out to be his bastard son.

He has been working with the [Erimesh](/f/the_erimesh.md) on the digsite and has been helping transcribe the language into Eshar. But something isn't fitting into the syntax.

This piece of human garbage has been buying slaves from all markets and infecting them with black. He has tried to reduce the dosage, but as it is an infection, they have all succumbed to it.

## Encounter with the Hadra


He was trying to find out what staved off the curse after his beloved and her family died of the black, but his son survived. He'd been trying to find out how to pass the blood though to blood. This bound them back to their animal forms. 

If they are not able to wring this confession from him, [Fallstaff](/p/fallstaff.md) can later, in a more pitiful if not humorous scene:

You can start as an interrogated prisoner, and creschendo toward the end.

"Before you kill me there is something more important than either of our lives I must tell you!"

> He was a very tall man, clad in steel mail finer than I have ever seen. It moved like rough cloth and covered his neck. It was dyed or stainded or powder-coated in something that made it really red. In his hands he held a helmet of horns, which he sat down and bid me and Erwin to sit next to. When he motioned, I could see that could see that there were 15 more tall figures all clad in green... And so I sat. He sat then and asked me: "Do you know why we are here?" -- I said it couldn't be all that bad, with trade and whatnot and how's about the higher learnin' and all Que Lorisumpisuemus he's talkin' Urchar. He askes me about the Pacts and I tells him some things he didn't know and pretty quick he's sent his army, (cause there was more than 16) back North, but he's put on his hat. Run away!"

Then, because this guy is such a jerk he always keeps something back, if they convince him further:

"And then he and his 5 generals gathered. I thought at first they were generals. But I realize now that I'd taken the badge of reds vs greens vs blacks as ranks: Red was commanders? Blacks were scouts, Greens were heavies.

But.. that wasn't how it worked. The ranks kinda followed those lines, but the colors didn't really mean anything at all -- there was no rank difference between them.

But they kept separated from the others. I was with that army for 5 hours while they got on the kinda horseflesh you'd shiv two biddies for. 

Well, then I figured as much, and then they all took off.

And so I think you should and so do you?

You think you've figured me out! I'm a bad guy! Look at what I've learned from this, then decide if you want to kill me! Let me be on trial!

This will be a particularily sweet moment if they are using Aunt Agnus or her saltboxes, when she sails into the room or (if they bring him back) into the courtbench. Or if they bring him back, Fallstaff. Maybe, every time they use the spell, he is there somehow, in the background, hidden like an octopus, watching in the waters. "I don't think it's my fault, that this is where I live?" The minds reach out and follow their prey.

His eyes snap open, and hope quickens his lips:

"There she is, my dark lady! How're you, Auntie? Did I run an rum game?"

yes -- and no

"Well, I have tucked away behind my ear? What is this? OH!"

And the cowbird lands on your shoulder. It's name is Chill.

"Oh and it's name is Chill, goodnight, sweetheart, I still believe in you!"

If any Aunt is nearby, she can render him to the abyss.

This guy filibusters, beatboxes, tells his life story, he rebuilds a D&D campaign, he sharadazes it until they finally trap his brain. This might be how they Meat Aunt Agnus for nicers the second time, and establish a relationship. If she helps them escape and peg this fuckmonkey,
