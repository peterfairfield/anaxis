# Iorek

First really really corrupt Wizard they meet. He is always looking for new blood and pays a premiem for it. He has contracted the disease but only he and his bastard son lived.

He has been working with the Erimesh on the digsite and has been helping transcribe the language into Eshar. But something isn't fitting into the syntax.

This piece of human garbage has been buying slaves from all markets and infecting them with black. He has tried to reduce the dosage, but as it is an infection, they have all succumbed to it.
