# Saad Khan

Former Kirkhall Warden Saad Khan has been imprisoned for plotting against the Upper Halls. 

He is actually innocent, but the hard evidence has certain forgeries on his person. He isnâ€™t so much interested in clearing his name, but in getting out of the city in a hurry. He will work with Bore if any jobs present themselves. He resides in the desert, in exile.
  

If they can bring him to report to Bore, that will win some warbucks. The Grey Clerics will be put on a boat prototype as Marines.

### General Khan

A missapplied title to the warhero of countless exchanges with the Empire. He has held a ragged front in the mountains, forging alliances with some Erimesh tribes and some older Empire families. He has many enemies amoung all factions and will pretty much be the butt of every intrigue that can take place.
