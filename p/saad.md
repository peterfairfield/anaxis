Former Kirkhall Warden Saad Khan has been imprisoned for plotting against the Upper Halls. He is actually innocent, but the hard evidence has certain forgeries on his person. He isnâ€™t so much interested in clearing his name, but in getting out of the city in a hurry. He will work with Bore if any jobs present themselves. He resides in the desert, in exile.

  
  
  

If they can bring him to report to Bore, that will win some warbucks. The Grey Clerics will be put on a boat prototype as Marines.
