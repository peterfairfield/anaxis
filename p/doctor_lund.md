Doctor Lund

Walking along the road, TP comes upon a old woman, doing laundry by a wide pool with a stream. She can tell you some things, but she will ask you who you are and where you are going. If you show her your acceptance letter into the Natural College, she will at first indulgently jibe you for taking her for a rube, but if she gets a look at it, she'll tell you to put it away and be careful who you show before you get to the city. She asks where you're from.

"Nununa, huh, wise choice. You should know that it's dangerous to flash that around anywhere. You shouldn't share certain things with strangers. But let me introduce myself."

"My name is Aunt Agatha. What is yours?"

"I have a lot of laundry to do, and more tommorrow, most likely. They say that Doctor Lund of the Natural College is coming to stay at the Pearled Pig. I've actually heard good things about him, unlike some of that order."

"He does have his ecccentricities however, you'll see what I mean. It is unusual, but not unheard of to have a great wizard visit. For many years, Tercal Tower was home to Doctor Fillstorm, and much of the bounty of the surrounding hillsides comes from his agronomy work."

Once TP finds the Pearled Pig, it will be packed. Farmers coming to town with food, merchants coming to trade, people coming out of the woods, off the river. The new threshing barn has become a common room still has place for the night.

Staying on the treshing floor are:
 1. The Madman, Idim Wayth. He has not yet seen Aos, but knows he is searching for something important. He will ask TP for help. He is throwing salt and drawing circles on the ground to protect himself.
 2. Johan Smith: He's working, watching over the carnival, he's rented out his house to a wealthy merchant, and his stables to a dragon prince. He knows the madman from relatives, and thinks he needs some help, or at least to let his family know where he is.
 3. Meribeth Hammel: She is the owner of the Pearled Pig, and is staying here as well
 4. Roberto Chandler: a halfling candlemaker, in town to keep the place lit!
 5. Alan Ash: aka Alain Bore: Standing in as a guard that Meribeth has hired. Came with trustworthy City credentials. Not many words, but concerned that bad things are going to happen.
 6. The Cider and the cider makers (there are 4 Cheeries)
  * Brewer Savern Cheery
  * Cooper Bully
  * Farmer Nell
  * Server Maude
 
Then Doctor Lund's mystery tour arrives.

Madness:

 "The ship that has lain in gold will find the waves again."

 "The Sun King will return!"

 "The Dragons will return! Hark, the tribes of Dan are gathered! She who has kill 7 husbands shall be Queen!
