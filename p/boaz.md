### Jefth and the Tome of Bol

He will pay them well to get a contact off of Itsalt Island, near off the coast of Lakash. The contact is the merchant Samuel Farris. Jefth will commission Captain [Buckfest](/p/). Farris is a complete doucheweasel. He’s stolen the Tome from the Empire, and he’s kinda smug about it. They can find out that he somehow tricked the Regent of Lakash, in fact he used blackmail. He has an annoying habit of somehow knowing everything. He is always asking awkwardly personal questions and then following them up with shocking questions. He will tell them that he has enemies everywhere, and some point on the journey, he will become convinced that a sailor on the boat hates him and wants to kill him.

The sailor on the boat hates him and is plotting to kill him, but they won’t reveal this until the rest of the crew can join them and take down the boat. The pirates come blasting out of the windward side of Kars Island, and bring a very large outrigger with aprox. 200 troops aboard. Buckfest makes a run for it, and he will reluctantly send up a signal for the Cutters, but it is too late, they cannot outrun the outrigger. The players may escape overboard, using their Deep Drafts, or they can stay and die. Buckfest will stay with the ship and will be most likely slain in the assault. If they escape, they will find the Docks and the Chippies swarming with agents of the Empire, mostly Erimesh who are mostly for hire, but also Ubiad agents. 

Skill challenge for the chase. Some Tearers add on, just for the Hunt. It is laundry day in the square, and soap gets everywhere. The horse-market is in full swing. A religious ceremony of worshippers of Obsidian blocks the path, or just a rundown Mammoth. If they are able to capture an Erimesh agent, he might be willing to tell him about his employers. The tome can be used to find an Isin artefact, the Lum, or small drinking pot, but it has to be translated, something the Empire wasn’t able to do, as it is written in Ramesh. In fact, there are few in the city who can read it and fewer who will admit it.

They will have to go to ground, but if they go to Jefth’s it has been subverted, but that might not be obvious from the outside. They will have to find a place to go to ground. Farris will recommend the most obvious enemies of the Erimesh: the oldblood Esharites, or the Finders. If they don’t want to show this asshat the Bothy, they can stay with Lady Horne or Hiram, if they have good relations with them. At some point, things will get so dicey in the city that even these powerful allies will try to smuggle them out of the city. 

If they get out, or if they start to use the book *Finders, Ava, Bore can read it), it will lead them to Kess Island, and back into the Labyrinth, at which point the book should start to freak them out. It will take them through to the artefact, but they will run into some allies (hard to say, given where/when the artefact might be/be from) who want Farris dead and the book returned to their sactuary. They have a lodestone for the book. Before they can make friends or enemies, the Empire will catch up with them, and they’ll get jumped. Xorns, guys on horses, or ethereal spiders, something that can kinda run with the Tome. The players should have a chance to retrieve it, but if they don't the lodestone will guide them.

The Artefact/Cyst
They will need the book to get at the thing, but the Empire might have started on that before they arrive. This would be a good thing to expand on. Maybe Mushussu shows up and helps them?
