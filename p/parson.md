If they ever get really sick: Healer in the Firest Forest, his blood as pure as the hills, he works to heal everyone he can. He is a very grumpy gnome. Many people dying unexpectedly in the city usually die on their way here, or not at all. Also bones that are found outside the city. This latest disaster has:

he has some things to show you about the bones:
    
    They are human
    They are not affected by any magic.
    They are covered in sap.


If there are any in the group who want to join the Natural College, he will help them with the paperwork. He has been a professor there for a long time.

Hook: [The Society](/f/the_stigian_society): Find out what is going on
[The Host](/f/the_host): Find out and put it out.

Hook: [The Kracken](/p/fallstaff): 

They will save him from an attack, he will give them a writ to invite them to the college. 

At some other time he can tell them
 * The tattoos on the bloodmen that attacked them were of Hozenah she of the Depths, the Tree of the Oak.
 * A Fellow of the [Natural College](/f/natural_college) has gone missing. There has been an earthquake and it has opened up something in the bay near where they jumped in. 
 * They have to go back and see their Aunt Elisa. Chuck Parson is pretty clear she is actually his aunt. He uses “aunt” if they push him.

Coming Back to Parson, looking for Elisa:

He can tell them, and he won’t lie to them if he knows them:
 * He doesn’t believe the [Natural College](/f/natural_college) is involved (false)
 * He is glad that the [Ten Pins](/l/ten_pins) has cleared it’s good name (false, he is glad they got clear)
 * He has found out where the Deep is. (true)
 * THere is an artifact of Water that has come to the city.
 * The Natural College doesn’t know where it is. He thinks to look down the Hole. 

He will give them potions of godown, no questions, no payment.

Coming Back for the intellect devourer
 * He will tell them that under no circumstances will he give up the devourer. 
 * The Bulls demand that everyone leave the premises and report outside. 
 * The entire city is shut down and martial law has been declared by the council. This is partially true, but the Host is in arms. 
 * This might be when the secret garrisons come forth. THat would be super exciting.

The Beowulf Bulls coming – they will be attacked. Parson goes on the offensive, but does not aim to kill until the Bulls escalate, which they do immediately. They don't respond well to resistance. If [Nate Hound](/p/nate) is amoung them, he will attack, but balk at actually putting anyone down permanently.

This is how Parson delivers his plea for help to escape the City (hopefully during a riot or some other form of martial law).
 * He insists that they head over the mountains to see the other side and rescue what culture and art they have before it is swept away by the Mes. 
 * This isn't an invasion, it's a cultural rescue mission. He'll want to head straight for the capital?
 * He may start on a run for [Silver Mountain](/l/the_silver_mountain), but once he figures out what is going on there, he will want to head for Alam and then [Altir](/f/the_empire) itself.

 Early on, he will seek them out and berate them about how things are going. He says that the Deep Law cannot be accepted until the seven slots are filled, and the lighthouse is the last slot. This means, if old Deverre dies, the last slot will be filled.

 They run a tourney. This can only be the work of some insane connessieur of brains. There are 200 youths chosen each year to be taken as tribute
