At this point, the Host will intervene and try to confiscate all of their evidence. If they resist the Tearers, they will be arrested, hopefully for something else they have done. If they allow themselves to be arrested, they can appeal to Bols, and if they manage to get an audience with him, but he’s likely to try to get them to do another  job.

If they suspect the Host, they can go back to Bard’s Library and use this information to narrow the list down. He tells them that Porter [sic] is in the archives at this time, as he was given permission from Roma to investigate. They find a dead librarian, and all hell breaks loose. They find the next step in the bowels of the Library. The librarian has a page from Kessler’s book gripped in its fist? The floors beneath them are blown up.
