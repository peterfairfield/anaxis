### When they get too close

At this point, the Host will intervene and try to confiscate all of their evidence. If they resist the Tearers, they will be arrested, hopefully for something else they have done. If they allow themselves to be arrested, they can appeal to Bols or Yung, if they know him, and if they manage to get an audience with him, but he’s likely to try to get them to do another  job.

### Pointing the finger

If they suspect the Host, they can go back to [Bard’s Library](/l/bards_library.md) and use this information to narrow the list down. Meatus tells them that Porter [sic] is in the archives at this time, as he was given permission from Roma to investigate. They find a dead librarian, and all hell breaks loose. They find the next step in the bowels of the Library. The librarian has a page from [Kessler’s](/p/kessler.md) book gripped in its fist? The floors beneath them are blown up.

The Mes Rescripted project has begun.

### Sarl Agab

He has maintained a complicated relationship with Sarl. He is prepared to head off the Erimesh bloodlessly, and is as often keeping tabs on the other Universities as the Erimesh. He has learned that there is much going on in the War College that he likely doesn't want to worry about. He has lost some credibility in the city for his work with the Erimesh, but it is Sarl who is called "The Tarsider". This will be a monicker that he will use later on.
