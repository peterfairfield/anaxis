## John Deverre

The owner of the island, a Finder with little care for the city, but mostly ignorant of the outside world. He keeps a strange menagerie of pets, including a Hippo. He is indulgent, friendly and a little debauched. He has heard of a great family treasure hidden on the island, or even within the keep. If he learns that it has opened up, he will want to investigate. He has no authority over the guards, but he will try to appeal to Hatchaxel, who is a newcomer. If he is killed and they go through his collection there are bound to be books to return to Bard’s or University Libraries. Some of them would enhance their collection, and be worth a pretty finder’s fee. He is obviously an old believer.
