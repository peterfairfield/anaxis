Tyrejere 

The [Nain](/p/nain.md) Affair.

Once he’s warmed to them ahem, knocked them around a bit, or let Bore do it if he’s around. If [Nate Hound](/p/nate.md) is around, he will mention that this is a punishment, not a training excercise (he gets that plenty) but a dumping ground for War College shits, which is a total lie. He also complains that his friend, Hatchaxel, has had such a rum go of it. This is not how he feels, he does it to make himself look stupid.

Tyrejere will tell them about the night in question. Nain had been recruiting for the Edo in this area. He had been working on a young group of newcomers, they had made some headway with some youngbloods.
 * Youngbloods call themselves Swamprats
 * the Bog Dogs might know them

## Bog Dogs

If the Bog Dogs were involved, things don’t look good for anybody, esp. If Fred is running with them now. They go from two dogs to three dogs at that point, see Changes of the City.

### Aunt Elisa

If they come looking for information on Lampry Aunt Elisa He first explains pedantically that she is a wizard.
