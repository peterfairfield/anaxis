Moshka Millhouse  
 + Goldsmith's Guild

He is the Executor’s handler and caretaker to the madman. He is a healer and primary care-giver to those who hurt themselves. He has a lot to do. There have been 2 other copycats in the town and he could use help fetching them.

He can provide helpful information about the madman and help record his ravings. He also makes note of the comings and goings of the Host to the party, whether his motives come from helping the Moshka or from a desire to oppose the Host, it isn’t clear till they see him at the Society Graduation. Aew guys, I thought you knew! All that stuff before, all made up! I have spoken to the madman! That was a ruse, all you’ve heard has been trickery! The truth is I am Aos, back from the dead!
