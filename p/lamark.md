# Lamark

## House Beowulf

Lamark, is an oldblood Beowulf, wears a Lord’s Ring. He has an idea of who stole the book: The Host. He is, of course, partially right. The security surrounding the brains was obscurity, and he is quick to point out his innocence by trying his best to help them. Lamark is hiding something, however, he has imprinted several of the brains on himself and is slowly going mad, remembering stuff from the Flint House attack, and things from the diary. He is also not a real Beowulf, but is a Finder playing Hal from the Host, who need him badly. He doesn’t want them to find that out, but he's bad at keeping secrets, so he just keeps his mouth shut sometimes.

## Private Collector

He is a collector and professor at Beowulf. Lamark began with Fallstaff at Natural College, but was hired by The Host to begin a College of the Mind at Beowulf.

## Archeology

Lamark will invite them to do something for house Beowulf, he might offer them a lesson in brain-archeology. His madness is mitigated by a ticture of fish guts, which he says clears his head. While they are meeting with him, he will be assassinated, and in way that will be highly suspicious. There will be warrents out all over the city. The 


## The Party Hunt

First, if they go charging after the assassins, please let them randomly run into a pile of Tearers, out for some blood for some reason or other. They pretty much cut loose. They will take this oppurtunity to put the players down. This could be a humorous fight until the bloodshed spreads and spreads as more Tearers join the fight. At some point, when actual Options start showing up, they will hopefully call it quits and flee.


## Paper Muster

Then it's a paper muster and patrols and the City goes haywire. First signs point them to Bolsinger's and professor Tobit Drake. If they go in guns blazing, they will find ample evidence that he's been spying on the Natural College and Falstaff's work. He will appear dead. If they are too agressive, his Deep Lord will protect him – maybe with enslaved guardsmen. If defeated, his spellbook and stuff are spectacular, but they will have a tough time with the Kraken if they kill him. He does keep notes of the people who assassinated Lamark, however.

If this goes well for them, throw the next encounter at them willy-nilly.

## Tobit Drake

If they seem reasonable, he will talk to them, but they will be interuptted by House Beowulf bruisers looking for answers with this lead they've just been given by the assassins. They will come in at totally the wrong moment and ruin everything. Especially once they see what Tobit has been doing.

## Edo Doubletap

Meanwhile they've heard of another killing in the same Oevre as the assassins. It was another Edo, this should be one of the Edo insiders, possibly [Reggie](/p/reggie_the_lame), and probably killed down in the [Harbor](/l/harbor). They find enough to identify him as a gravedigger for Lamark, and an Edo if they know what to look for. If they linger over the body, [Siobane](/p/siobane) will come over and offer to do a card reading. She slights the cards in a particular manner, denoting death rogue knight tower sun. They silver her, or perhaps she curses them?

## To the House of Pain

The next place is the only place in town that fit the Oevre perfectly at this point: Fillstorm. They will find him frantically working on this new animal he has found: an intellect devourer. He tells them that Lamark threatened to syc his Beowulf grunts on him unless he handed it over. He threatens him with retribution from the Kraken folks if he doesn't comply. As Prime Edo, Parson knows that this guy is from Aunt Agnus. 

"He threatened everyone here. He said if I didn't have this to him tonight that I could look forward to a visit from the Beeves."

He might give them clues to send them straight at Aunt Agnus, if he's worried about her, or have them take off after the assassins, but before he can those Beowulf Beefs show up. Ibid

## Moske Hideout

The assassins have been trying to get to Shawn, but so far, just been picking at its agents. 

Showdown O'clock, when they go after the Moske hideout. There are some reasonable people there who try to talk to them about what happened, but then the assassins show up in force.

  

Falstaff's house is burning, probably the Flint House. If they find Falstaff he will say that this is all a cleanup on behalf of some higher-ups. He can tell them where those guys are, but they aren't going to like it.

  

The Rock: and killing a lot of the right people. Some of them probably get away.
