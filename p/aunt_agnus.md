## Aunt Agnus
 + Agnatha

She of fresh waters and hard scales. She brings many mighty gifts, and will not be deterred. Lamprey.

### The Tower of Aunt Agnus

Big Tentacles, oh my. The island has a lake, and the lake is deep. There are tentacles in the lake. A huge monster tree. It tries to eat them, in a friendly way. It smells so sweet and it sings so gently. The island seems really pleasant, suddenly there are motes of light and everything sounds like it is far away. You can somehow see better, see clearer. The aboleth enters your mind for the first time. Agnus asks you what you most desire. You know you must tell the truth.

This is when [Edo Rian](/p/rian.md) springs into action, if he’s still alive. He will mindblank them all with scrolls and then tells them to proceed as they wish. He will have the Spirit with him, if they let him have it, and maybe Option Bols, if he survived so far. Bols will meet Fred soon. That is going to be the tightest of bonds in the City, as it Changes. 

At the confrontation, if they can introduce to Agnus a solid connection within the Natural College, she will put off the war of succession. The seas can be at peace. It’ll be known as the 11 hours war. There was even a successful mutiny. Maybe the moon will come up. The Admiral’s College is in absolute uproar. Josriel is an Admiral and she will be running a squadrun of Host Ships to run them to ground, wherever they might be. This will come to be known as the First Fleet, as it is the first to go into the Moongate. When you go through, the boat is dumped upside down in the water, with you on the bottom. That’s about all. If the party is there, they get to meet the Sun King instead of Josriel. He will be swimming for his life off the Reed Island.

Aftermath: someone was bound to slip up. Either they know more about Roma, Bore, Agnus, or Nain after this, or Silar will notice something and give them a mission to check up on, because he’s a smart guy. There is the mystery of the ship and of the disappearance of Saxon and Gladhand’s fleet.
