# General Narses

If there are near the pit, the return of Narses will trigger some tentacular action otyughs etc. Narses communicates via anepigraphic tags. They may be able to tell that these sigils are similar to those found at the House of Mushussu in Tuskharbor. If they head that way, the trolldrops begin in earnest. The sigils are written primarily in ancient Eschar, but they occasionally go off in a language that is similar to Hill speak, render phonetically.
