The assault on the Flint House.

The King of Altir sent his Narssi to conquor the people of Eshar and Lagash

The King of Lagash sent Sparye Pesa with 40 men to hold the Flint House against the Hadrad army. When they arrived, they found wine in casks that the Hadrad had left behind and they drank them all, because they had never seen wine before. When they tried to quench their thrist, they found that the well at the Flint House had been poisoned with rotten flesh and some of them fell ill.

Six of the men were sick and did not drink the wine, so in the morning, when all the men were winesick, Sparye sent the six to fetch fresh water from the Firest Forest.
