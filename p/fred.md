## Fred Deverre
 - Glassmaker
 - Finder heir (human)
 - He has an affection for Porter, as they have taken the fall and murdered their own father to save his. 
 - Bore is the cupbearer who brought the Lighthouse back into position. He has restored the Finders to thier proper place on the three councils. You'll find they avail themselves of every seat at every meeting. They also have 3 ways to weasel seats that they've come up with over the years. The goal here is to get the pirates and the city people to agree to use their strenths together. Create a weasel-house for the weasels to have weasel dances (it is practically a school of martial arts). Then there are 2 other chambers that allow for actual deliberation on these fronts: Defense & Offense. If you are in the wrong house, you get expelled to the other one.
 
 The University was an idea drawn from the unification of several houses of learning, 

 Here is the story of his birth and his father. When the Host moved the Navy to Hook Island, there were workers from the Hill people brought in to build the infrastructre, farming patties, canals and bridges. Some of these hill people were highly skilled in these things and prominent amoung then was Tomas, Fred's father. He gave away all of his wealth to the less fortunate and lived by gifts from the community. King Solen began a decree that the bodies of the dead were to be brought to the necropolis and buried in the Hadrad style. It became illegal to burn corpses in the hill people style, or to leave them out for the birds. 

His father began burning the corpses of friends and family, and also people found him, asking to be allowed to pay to have their loved one burn, but once he knew of a body, he would go and burn it, so long as it was of the hill people. 

Then he was banished to the hills and all of his household moved to Tel Kur, but even there he was harried by the Host until he and his wife found a hut in the wilderness.  

The Hadrad were driven from the city and from the right and left resevoirs. King Solen was slain by his sons, and the twins fled to Silver Mountain. The Youngest son inherited the position as Leader of Hosts. 

He hired Tomas' brother Deverre to oversee the rebuilding (The Current Lord Deverre's adoptive father) of the city. He invited Tomas to return and reestablish his place in the City, but he returned to Tell Kur and made a safe place for the hill people there.

The Lords of the City sent a man to kill Tomas, but Tomas was able to convince him that he was innocent of the plot he was accused of, and they were able to fake his death.

His son was sent to Deverre for safekeeping, and to remove suspicion. Fred grew up by the lighthouse, best friends with Deverre's son, John.

There is something Babbi Fran has revealed to Tomas that will cure Ava of her curse. It may have to do with the wolf blood. It may actually be driving out a demon, or something like that.
