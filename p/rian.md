## At the Party

"I am currently working on an article on the trial."

"The trial of Hatchaxel. It seems to me without a doubt that he was conducting a legitimate rat hunt. There is something horrible in the idea that armed men might charge into our houses and murder us, but the hunt was sanctioned by the givers."

"It took five of them you know, Hatchaxel was the only one who survived."



"The givers have for many years expired the Kirkhalls liens. Most of the these are small apartments."

I have been reading those laws, and many of them moved to a pur autre vie entailment, and after several houses went through some chaos, they settled on the the Prince of Cats. This very building that we are in will fall into the hands of the Kutha if these documents are made known."

"Here it is."

"Lagash is about to go to war with Eshar. But this is all within your power tonight. The delegation from Lagash is here."

"If they were allowed to reclaim their portions of the Kirkhalls in the city, they would accept citizenship of Eshar and stregthen the cities defenses. King Pyre has sworn he will reopen the Silver Mountian, against the will of his Emporer, who, I believe is also here tonight, incognito."

"What do you make of the entertainment? The story of Babbi Fran and his obedient children? They come in tithes? In some stories, they have the tablets of destiny, on which the future of everything is written. They no more choose to ride the Wave-Finder than not choose. What are laws to such people as they, who know what is to happen? What a convienent place for them to go, but down to Ram's Shelf and remain there, unable to trouble our lives here in Eshar?"

"What does go on in the mind of someone who is breaking the law? This has been what I've studied, in the books and writing books. I don't know if much of our understanding of justice could stand, if we were actually able to inhabit someone else's mind? Then again, we often do things in drunkeness or passion that we regret, regarless of our feelings of justice at the time, and wish that we did not do."

"I am a chronicler of reget, I hope. To bring those regrets to the fore and... forge from them: the law." 

## Discoverer of the City beneath the waves

## Archeologist

He is a fellow of the Natural College, and has dabbled in brains and other things. He is aware of some of the things going on in the Natural College, he is most concerned about the Maw of the Gyre and is frequently found on the Eye. There are some theories about un-limited energy and it has got him a bit worried. He could push them into infilatrating the Natural College to check up on his suspicions. 

## Infiltrating the Natural College

This is down in the Harbor, if they contact [Askha'hale](/p/askhahale.md) he will be happy to show them the back door, but warns that nothing comes for free in the Natural College.

Coming in the front: Skill Challege A Natural College fellow will 
Coming in the back: Riding the Remoraz.

Also by the harbor: Bolsigners and Aunt Elisa's tower. Here they will find a very powerful ally: Aunt Elisa. She will be very critical of anything about them she doesn't like, but with the abiding caring of an aunt. She is also very concerned about the Gyre, and wants to find out more, and thinks the Eye is the place to search, after the Natural College itself. Someone is currently in charge of harmixing the storm, but she can't find out who it is, and she knows that some day, whomever is doing it is going to mess up and hurt a lot of people. Elisa will arm them up with enough stuff to fuck up a demon army and insist they wear all of it.

She may also mention that Fallstaff was once a fellow. She's probably put her memories in a jar somewhere. Lamark will know quite a bit, as he's been spying on the Natural College this whole time.

She sends the Pale Bears with them, wherere they may go.

The Harbor, regardless which way they pick is alive with the eyes of the Natural College, if they know Ask or another member, they will let them know that the place is a hotbed of sycophants and spies. They actually aren't all nearly that bad. Someone might suggest using the rivally between Bolsingers and Natural, which would lead them to Aunt Elisa.

## [Dugma Dern](/p/dern.md)

Doorkeeper for the Natural College. If they come without introduction, he will pass them off to a student to give them a tour of the place. She is a young girl called Hannah. She is certain that they are here to try to do something illegal and can't stop ribbing them about it. She introduces them to the 3 Basic Orders and their various labs and lecture halls. 

## The Usual Suspects

 * The Cook: Brother Gurth -- he isn't too involved, but is easily controlled through his girlfriend.
 * Nym. hehehe -- Finder, and they don't really know what he wants.
 * Bookbinder Oksana
 * Mayhe Samson -- clearly Silverfolk
 * Cheres Naxas -- alchemist & keeper of the Halfhouse
 * Ask?

If pushed to the question they will have some lies lined up that seem real reasonable.

Random Encounters in the Natural College:
1. Danoi Enclave: They will complain about what they call "Golddiggers" and deplore their behavior. They will start to argue about which language they were using to talk to each other privately, some of them guessing Erimesh, others some Silver dialect.
2. The Kitchens: They have been recieving a large amount of boxes and deliveries through the wagons.
3. Attempts to poison them.
