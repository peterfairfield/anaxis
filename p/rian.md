## Discoverer of the City beneath the waves



## Archeologist

He is a fellow of the Natural College, and has dabbled in brains and other things. He is aware of some of the things going on in the Natural College, he is most concerned about the Maw of the Gyre and is frequently found on the Eye. There are some theories about un-limited energy and it has got him a bit worried. He could push them into infilatrating the Natural College to check up on his suspicions. 

## Infiltrating the Natural College

This is down in the Harbor, if they contact [Askha'hale](/p/askhahale.md) he will be happy to show them the back door, but warns that nothing comes for free in the Natural College.

Coming in the front: Skill Challege A Natural College fellow will 
Coming in the back: Riding the Remoraz.

Also by the harbor: Bolsigners and Aunt Elisa's tower. Here they will find a very powerful ally: Aunt Elisa. She will be very critical of anything about them she doesn't like, but with the abiding caring of an aunt. She is also very concerned about the Gyre, and wants to find out more, and thinks the Eye is the place to search, after the Natural College itself. Someone is currently in charge of harmixing the storm, but she can't find out who it is, and she knows that some day, whomever is doing it is going to mess up and hurt a lot of people. Elisa will arm them up with enough stuff to fuck up a demon army and insist they wear all of it.

She may also mention that Fallstaff was once a fellow. She's probably put her memories in a jar somewhere. Lamark will know quite a bit, as he's been spying on the Natural College this whole time.

She sends the Pale Bears with them, wherere they may go.

The Harbor, regardless which way they pick is alive with the eyes of the Natural College, if they know Ask or another member, they will let them know that the place is a hotbed of sycophants and spies. They actually aren't all nearly that bad. Someone might suggest using the rivally between Bolsingers and Natural, which would lead them to Aunt Elisa.

## [Dugma Dern](/p/dern.md)

Doorkeeper for the Natural College. If they come without introduction, he will pass them off to a student to give them a tour of the place. She is a young girl called Hannah. She is certain that they are here to try to do something illegal and can't stop ribbing them about it. She introduces them to the 3 Basic Orders and their various labs and lecture halls. 

## The Usual Suspects

 * The Cook: Brother Gurth -- he isn't too involved, but is easily controlled through his girlfriend.
 * Nym. hehehe -- Finder, and they don't really know what he wants.
 * Bookbinder Oksana
 * Mayhe Samson -- clearly Silverfolk
 * Cheres Naxas -- alchemist & keeper of the Halfhouse
 * Ask?

If pushed to the question they will have some lies lined up that seem real reasonable.

Random Encounters in the Natural College:
1. Danoi Enclave: They will complain about what they call "Golddiggers" and deplore their behavior. They will start to argue about which language they were using to talk to each other privately, some of them guessing Erimesh, others some Silver dialect.
2. The Kitchens: They have been recieving a large amount of boxes and deliveries through the wagons.
3. Attempts to poison them.
4.


## The Maw

He has witnessed people using it and thinks the effects are too dangerous. He dissapproves of it's usage within the city, at least.
