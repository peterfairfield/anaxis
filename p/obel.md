## Dorian
 
### Theatre assassin. 

He’ll be part of the handoff of the Egg, or the Dagger. He will enjoy trying to figure out who they are, but usually goes with the most ridiculous theories. He will

Hand off a fake.
They will set him up to plant a tracer on him.
Verify their bona fides and then attack.
They will be employed by the [Beef Rake Hats](/f/the_beef_rake_hats.md) to take him out.
Sell them what they were actually looking for.

He is a very good assassin, not as smart as he thinks you are.

### [Saad Khan](/p/saad.md)

An agent of Masque, Dorian Obel. gets caught up in this, trying to set up and betray Saad and the Chosen at the same time. Capturing this guy alive wins big warbucks, especially if they can take him alive. Bore will use him to crack the Masquerade like an egg.
