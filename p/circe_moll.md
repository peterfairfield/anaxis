She’s been trying to get off the island for years, but has always found a reason to stay. She has apparently lived on the island her whole life, but she looks far older than she is.

  

She may start to hide certain things that go on, and tries to keep them from finding the Experiment, including the personal hovels of the islanders. If this doesn’t work, she will distract them somehow:

1.  Porter’s notes carefully rehidden in his safe. They are intelligence reports about the island and it’s customs.The notes seem in proper order, but the man does not. He is addicted to a cocktail of Kars plants and fungus, 15 various hidden satchels they can find if they search the village, and appears to be mad. Porter is a very good spy for the Ymil (Roma or Bore) and their superiors in the Society. Circe knows of Porter’s role for the Ymil, but not anything of the Society project. He is there to whitewash intelligence.
    
2.  Where the madman came from.
    
3.  The ghost ship’s description and name.
    
4.  If they do search the houses, they may notice that some of the beams of the houses are made of parts of the ship that Porter describes. Is he mocking them? Or has he met them before and makes it obvious in pantomime that he’s not a madman? He also is really fungus dependent.
    
5.  House 1: a smoke house House 2: A domicile, circular with bunks. 3. Longhouse made of huge timbers 4. Another house, stone, with a cave. Some shacks.
