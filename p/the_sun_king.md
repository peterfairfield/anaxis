#### The Greeting

253 years ago, I first stepped on this land. I was in a terrible pickle, with enemies quickly hunting me. Climbing up the cliff face where I now stand, I beheld the sun set upon the Long Lake, and my heart was lifted by the sight of the Akaerak Poles. There surrounding the lake were fishing poles and there rested the fishermen of Cham, hailing this ragged stranger standing on their slopes. They fed me and showed me how to fish in the Binding Lake for my supper.

Later, these people took me to their sacred island which they once called the Eye. They showed me how to read the runes, and showed me how I might retake Isin. I called for clay and quill and wrote The City. Our last act before leaving the Far Shore had been to recapture the looted library of The Mind. We carefully translated these texts into Clay and founded the Universities. In 50 years we’d built the cities and roads. Then in 100 we conquered all the land around us, and freed their people to rule under their own leadership. 50 years ago, our policies with the Northern Alliance led to our partnership. What this all led to was the creation of the greatest army I have ever seen. Those fishermen, those northern traders, of cedar and silver. Those Keepers of the Chest of Tiamat.

Now must I come to the matter at hand: so long as the moon holds the sky, the sea-road to Esh will remain open. This moon will not last long, perhaps 20 years. We will not leave these lands undefended. If we were to withdraw all armies at once, the chaos sewn in the outer reaches of the empire would be catastrophic, and the Northern Kingdoms would probably rebel. (Cheers) But I will only be taking half of all forces with me when I depart in 6 months. The rest of them will have their hands full rearming and training the next 39 waves of fleets.

These will be very difficult years, for all of us, but the fate of those going in the ships will be worse. They will face foes unimaginable, and hordes innumerable. Isin has once again gone into a horrible Expansion, and has determined that this world will become subsumed. It’s mind and will have bent our way, and only through its own weapons do we dare oppose it. There will not sail a ship without a Bindstone aboard.

Have you not felt the tug of Isin on your soul? A fatigue, a soullessness, that Mask of despair. Here I will  plant the first Iron Rose, to grow here from the city and provide it with Rose Iron. I will bind it with a blade crafted by my hand, the green glass.

The ships I have brought were built in Isin. They are lined with gold, which is more easily available there.

The first gift is gold & economic collapse. The second is the invasion of the Empire. The third is the corruption of the Kraken.

I have brought with me too much gold to put on the market all at once. Please let me know if you want to get into safely offloading a lot of gold. The first groups of people and any of their friends who are caught trying to get the gold, are going on the first ships that will begin to sail next week. The Deep and the Green are with us!


When they step up to the flint house, they see the same sight. The sun setting, the fishermen, the island. Make that experience of the Adventure to the Eye, perhaps with silly details. The King, after all, is a fool.
