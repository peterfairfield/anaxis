# Ava Gavin

## University College

A very talented fellow at the University College, she operates the Observatory. She doesn't trust Meatus, but thinks of him as a brute. She is an elf with extremely fine features. She doesn’t like how the security was breached by mynim working the old diamond mines. Inspection of the rooms of missing material can tell them that someone broke in from the inside first, destroyed the protective rooms. They can find trollsign, and maybe if they are good, where the troll drop landed.

  
## Lord Saxon

She is worried that her employer, [Lord Saxon](/p/lord_saxon.md), is going to use this to force her to accept security (read spies) at the Observatory. There is a bunch of other stuff that is missing as well, magical experiments she has been conducting with her students. She doesn’t want a bunch of bafoons running around the library. If they pull off the deal with Lord Sack, she will become helpful, otherwise, she tries to get rid of them. If they can reveal the scale of attack to her, she will start to move the books to the University. She can tell them stories of the book-burnings that were halted by her family, of the missing libraries and history of Acklan and how the books were smuggled out and saved by riding out the next 400 years in a barrel sealed with bitumen.

  
## Ymil

She isn’t as keyed into the who and what of the [Ymil](/f/ymil.md), Society and BRC are up to, but she does know signals intelligence, and uses it to talk to [Fred](/p/fred.md), with something she believes is the Moon Child. His dreams have been getting more and more worrisome for her, such that she’s considering a trip out to the island to find out what is going on.

  
## Finders

Ava is an old family [Finder](/f/the_finders.md), and has been told that she will find love among the first lords of the city. She has had 7 husbands, and they have all died.

What is the source of this evil thing? A demon that comes and kills her husbands, or is it the City itself?

Can we get a triangle between Parson, Ava and Fred? Straight choice, with maybe some mutual respect available to the players? Always present them with an easier choice if they betray the other. Ava might go looking for [Fred](/p/fred.md). 

## Fred has dissappeared

About around time she decides to come looking, he wants to remain hidden. He will enter the city and it will Change, the three events that Change the City are: Queen, King, and Marriage. Fred will be opposed by the Finders, the Host and the Colleges.

As the cards come up, there is a lean you can pull from each card (maybe the front side) the backside is all of the other rules. He is going to pull up and wreck some house. Fred Halfelven will hit all of the major trade goods, all guilds and and artisans. The triumph of the Egyptians over the sea peoples, the barbarians. The great and venereal society of the Most Ancient City. They are the ones trying to stab Fred in the back. The Opera will start this message, and imprint it in the minds of those. Fred has enemies among his own faction, those who are trying to rewrite history, and erase the phonetic sylvan.

## Screeds

Fred’ sacrifice is to die to allow the group of his own people who don’t want their written system eradicated. Fred begins to compose screeds that are wildly read throughout the Chippies and the Forest. He has some really good things to point out about what is going on. He is a Finder in name, and with the help of other Finders, the party might be able to bring the more radical elements to the table: perhaps a meeting between the Society and a Giver of Green?

## Rescriptivists Resurgent

The major texts are taken out by the bulldozers. They only came to smash, not to grab. This rubble can be reconstructed to find the life blood of information. They might meet Roma. “You know, the advantage of my line of work is, people can never be sure that it might not be the case that…  are working for me or with me? or not?” What is written and recorded about her movements. She is new chaos leaking off her.

## Second Reveal's the same as the first
