Three crones attend the pots and cook for the village. They don’t seem to leave the campfire. Their soup has been poisoned, but not by them, by Porter, in advance of the attack:

1.  They will tell you a story (fight scene)
    
2.  They will tell you something about the Sun King: He will be a shaper of glass.
    
3.  They also saw the ghost ship. They can back up Porter’s story and probably add details.
    
4.  They need more stuff from the forest, be a dearie and fetch it?
    
5.  They can tell you where the merchant ship’s logs are. (yes, the ship of Captain Fillstorm, and the attack of the ghost ship that happened 50 years ago)
    
6.  They are givers of the green – the crazy kind? 
    
7.  They have recently been offered a way for them to proceed with the protection of their island with an offer of the deed from the Natural College, if they do not take their turn in the Game. It has been 7 years since their last move, and everything has been deadlocked.
    
8.  They have decided to destroy the city and will not begin the leaf game. The other leaf players cannot move until they make their move.
    
9.  They can fly, and eat babies.
    

  

Resolutions for this drawing:

If the party can get a contact in the Natural College higher up and introduce them to a contact of the Leaf Game, they will resolve this overarching conflict. The Natural College will get a move in the Game and the Game will go on. Otherwise, Hiram’s actions block them, although at the cost of Magd.

  

Hesitations: 

If there is lull, Bols can show up and start searching door to door, with a band of Tearers. He has come overland from the other end of the iron road, and may meet them there, coming the opposite way. If the marines show up, they will halt in awe and Bols will move to assist them. The sailors he has little time for, but WILL process all of the unregistered crew among them.

  

There is a Smokehouse it holds secrets

1.  Salt, rocks and coal.
    
2.  Some notes stuffed behind an old brick. A ship’s log.
    
3.  Some normal looking byproduct of the experiment. The corpse on an Elf.
    
4.  The key to the circle.
    
5.  Bide a while. Smoke. They are Inner Circle, but will not convene. This is so they can continue the experiment, and build power through influence with the Society. As this is Bore’s experiment and Roma’s to clean up, a nice Fellowship ceremony might clear things up.
