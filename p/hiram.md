Hiram Naxas
Is intense. If he hears that Hatchaxel is on the run, he will run them down with his seawolves. He will overtake the yacht, take her or sink her. His mania and cannon cojoin in such beauty, you realize he a thing of the sea itself, a spirit of thunder and lightening, waves and wind.

### Sea Caves

### Cutter Hiram Naxas

Pirate and Sealord, a servant of Edo. He has been behind most of the attacks, so far. He will probably attack the party and maybe ask questions later, if he finds them tough to crack.


### Giver of Green
  
He is determined to use the chaos created by the ghost ship to his advantage. He wants his marines to take the settlement and force the crones to convene the Game. He suspects someone is manipulating them, or somehow keeping them captive. He doesn’t know that Bore is using him. He will probably kill Porter if we figures out what he is doing there.  
  
He will not be happy about Bols’ presence, but will try to move quickly to put the blame on the crones and frame their actions in the most dangerous light.

### Hunting Hatchaxel

He want them to raise sails fore and aft. He explains running-rigging like this “you have to feel which way the rope doesn’t want to go and make it go.”

He then later, when the weather does a crazy turn. Square sails! Every inch up top! And take down the gaff. She likes flying straight over the ways, Keep an eye on your lines!“ And he spins the wheel, ties it to a rope around his foot and jumps to the rescue. He is clearly awesome.

He is going to have them run forward and raise a top-gallant. Even if it is raining, they might be able to spot the ettercaps amoung the crew, or notice that some of the spars are tightened with a find monofiliment thread, and sealed with resin. If they can get the topgallant up, they or if they botch the gaff, he'll just dump them in the ocean and toss them potions.

Then he tosses them each a godown potion, while they stand in the sudden calm of the deck. All of the hands are scrambling down to war positions. As they jettison the evidence, Hiram is watching on the telescope. Hiram tells them, “Shuck over m’lads, get that strongbox and we’ll be back for ye in an hour, and stay under until you can breathe the air. 

Buey, rope, anchor, he tosses it at the centre of the splash. There isn’t much wind, Hiram knows that they can outsail him for a bit, but when they out of the lee of the horn, the wind will open up. He promises to be back in an hour when the potion wears off and tells him he needs every sailor aboard to handle the ship.

## Down in the Depths

The line pays way way out. They are finally far enough out to meet the Kraken’s people. They have the box and merely want to talk to you about it before you go. Skum look mostly human, but they are capable of stripping down and turning into Slimefish. They are the hagfish people, and can bring a wash stream of slime twisting all around you, while their friends finish you off. Then sahaguin attack, pinging the water with electric pulses and with a stun and finish attack. They are insanely deady and only with the healing of the Slimy Druidess do they make it through, if they have left her alive.
