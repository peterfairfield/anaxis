Sea Cave

Hiram Naxas
Is intense. If he hears that Hatchaxel is on the run, he will run them down with his seawolves. He will overtake the yacht, take her or sink her. His mania and cannon cojoin in such beauty, you realize he a thing of the sea itself, a spirit of thunder and lightening, waves and wind.
  

Cutter Hiram Naxas

Pirate and Sealord, a servant of Edo. He has been behind most of the attacks, so far. He will probably attack the party and maybe ask questions later, if he finds them tough to crack.

  
He is determined to use the chaos created by the ghost ship to his advantage. He wants his marines to take the settlement and force the crones to convene the Game. He suspects someone is manipulating them, or somehow keeping them captive. He doesn’t know that Bore is using him. He will probably kill Porter if we figures out what he is doing there.  
  
He will not be happy about Bols’ presence, but will try to move quickly to put the blame on the crones and frame their actions in the most dangerous light.
