  

Cutter Hiram Naxas

Pirate and Sealord, a servant of Edo. He has been behind most of the attacks, so far. He will probably attack the party and maybe ask questions later, if he finds them tough to crack.

  
He is determined to use the chaos created by the ghost ship to his advantage. He wants his marines to take the settlement and force the crones to convene the Game. He suspects someone is manipulating them, or somehow keeping them captive. He doesn’t know that Bore is using him. He will probably kill Porter if we figures out what he is doing there.  
  
He will not be happy about Bols’ presence, but will try to move quickly to put the blame on the crones and frame their actions in the most dangerous light.
