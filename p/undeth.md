# Undeth Mythros

She serves as enforment to the General. Together with her captains, she has been able to become the formost arm of the formost army of the Empire. She is obsessed with the truth, paladin of the [crown](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/paladin:crown) she uses her Champion Challege on Pyre, before he heads down the bank.

The Hadrad Augurs (they often have long horns and glowing eyes). The ancient Pyre, slowly embers into ash-tipped hair. He wears it long and in locks behind his back. These were once very tight braids, but they are a litle chopped, worried or burnt.

As they approach the lava flow, the greens and the ettercaps will have a conversation, and the players can join in or get killed. The greens will not back down from this one; they are far away from home and they have a mission to fulfill.

"Oh, now that I'm dead, I'm not afraid of those guys anymore." He can be resurrected to serve as figurehead of their ship? It might be good to build this guy up. 

Undeth Mythros is a Pricess of the Greens. Her tree has become a ship and has sailed down one river and up the next to find her. If they can pull her off the mountain and to Aunt Agnus, she can save her and the others bodies are prepared for their journey out to sea. They will visit the isles and bring them back, with Parson's help.

If she isn't the caulker, she might be a good alternative.

Her Captains: (Bastards raised from old blood)
 - Stalker Oneharm -- Blue, but sent from their side, to keep an eye on Undeth.  His other arm as regrown, but something is wrong with it. He is a Wizard of Alam. He is a zard, but probably a bladesinger.
 - Kilsier Frates -- Hexlock
 - Athanos Grim -- Grave cleric assassin.
 - Gigantus Phriapus -- huge dude from Alam. Seven feet tall before the horns, and he uses the Bow/Crossbow, whatever form is the meanest. He uses all the nastin Fighter, Rogue and Ranger ultimate Assassin.
 
## Stalker 

They will happen upon him in a non-violent scenario, and he will recognise them from someplace. He thinks they are servents of Aunt Agnus and are essentially on a fact-finding missing for the defence of the delta. He will take them to see Undeth. He will pretend to speak broken Eschar, and will try his best to come off as an idiot, perhaps complaining about the food?

## The Deal

They have started to suspect that they might need to start topple the Empire in order to survive. Undeth has captured a white imperial courier. She is warded by Imperial Seal, which means she is in an antimagic shell. She is a wizard. Aunt Agnus also has emmisaries, if the party aren't already representing her. Largely, they wish to help the Captain and prevent violence against her. 

Undeth has already attempted to assassinate the Emporer, and he is currently either dead or MIA. But that is only part of her plan. She is also going to unleash King Pyre on his suicidal attempt to rebirth the species. She will try to convince them to jump the Emporer and give them as much weaponry and intelligence as she can.

## The Emporer

The most ancient half-dragon

## Ixasax Red

She will play dead.

While they are inspecting her, she will learn the location of the Emporer. She will offer to guide them to him in exchange for her life. Undeth wants to facilitate this deal, if she thinks the players can get the job done. She warns them about his strengths and gives them some poppers and bangers.

All they can tell from good sense motives is that she is fantastically overstressed and desperate. This is such a long shot, but if it works, then they all get to live again.

They have to believe her.
