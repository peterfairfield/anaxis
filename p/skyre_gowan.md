# Skyre Gowan Roan

When asked about the ghost ships:
 * [Aunt Elisa](/p/aunt_elsela) has been spending a lot of time in the depths and going deeper and deeper  
 * Elisa sometimes gets too obsessed and in too deep with things.    
 * She has a knack for showing up at just the wrong time with the right motivations, but sometimes she does the opposite.
    
Later, when they can tell what she is Haggity hag swamp hag: 

 * That the givers of green don’t really have any hierarchy, but they do not ever move on their own, there must be three giver. (She was involved with Hiram’s takeover of the Island and the new beginning of the game)   
 * She will offer whatever [Bore](/p/bore) offered and more. She knows [Roma](/p/roma).   
 * She has some research on the Stigians, if she feels they are safe enough. This is very cryptic.  
 * She doesn’t know that the Edo are behind this, she knows some of them, and is surprised they are mixed up in this, if they tell her about [Parson](/p/parson) Fillstorm.    
 * [Aunt Elisa](/p/aunt_elsela) has had an old tower in Finder’s Cove for a long time, somewhere belowthe observatory. Perhaps the city lights are why the people there keep dark streets, around the observatory “For the Lady in the Tower” they will kiss their hands and wave to [Ava](/p/ava)
 * They may have to go into the [Beef Rake Hats](/f/the_beef_rake_hats) and beat some information out of them. It’s called “parley”
    
Once the City Changes, Skyre will be given a pile of free power from somewhere, and starts to freak out/ become wary. She starts to see things, but her powers can be augmented by forming a coven. So this or Elisa or [Ava](/p/ava) or Roma, some of the Players?

Who is the bad guy that Skyre Gowan needs to hunt down? A bunch of Empire Oni-cronies? The Game? We need more Game. Wraiths, Shadows, showdowns, excitement. Is it the Empress come to claim the Sun King as her consort? Or maybe someone claiming Bore as a ersatz Roma?
