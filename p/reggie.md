  

Reggie the Lame

Disfigured by the experiment, grotesquely larger on his left side. He struggles with bouts of rage, but wants to get news to the Leaf Game, and doesn’t understand why it hasn’t started. He doesn’t know about Porter or the Crones. He won’t trust anyone who isn’t in the leaf game. He might just try to eat them, if he can’t sort it out. Reggie likes a good show of strength and a bit of the old stabby stabby.
