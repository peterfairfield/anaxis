He is the Theatre operative in charge of finding out what they know about the missing books. He will give them a lesson in subterfuge if they give him information as well.

```
Wide sensual mouth with rich lips. He talks quickly and to the point. Magnus adds gravitas.

This is what he has to share:

 1. The book was the original diary of [Keesler](/p/keesler.md) during the defense of the Flint House.
 2. There were a lot of strange drawings and sigils which were never transcribed out of the book for print editions.
 3. If they fight well when he jumps them, he will help them out, seemly out of goodwill? Perhaps he thinks they are up to something else, and wants to check them out.
 4. His training will give you a 1d4 bonus on persuasion checks with Nobles.
 5. He knows about the Pyramid and what the Natural College is doing. Something is obviously wrong with the information coming back from his agent.
 6. He does not work for the Moshka.
 7. The Moshka don’t funnel all information in the city down a gigantic tube and feed it to order for high prices.
 8. He doesn’t know who he really works for, but he’s willing to do a job now and again to put on a new Opera.
 9.  We are going to call this, “The Skinflayer Betrayer” or “Love on the Water” “Fyre Upon The Skyye”
