## Quartermaster Javier of Port Thunder

He has been horribly in love with [Shanty](/p/aunt_elsela.md) his whole life. He has worked with her on 2 occasions, once when he was elected quartermaster and then again after the fleet action when the Empire tried to retake the Outer Islands. 

The first time, he had been running his ex-bosun to ground, after he'd run from an embessiblement investigation. He was at a loss for how to prove his bosun innocent until Professor Elsela showed the council what she'd been working on; the first godown. She was able to show him to the wreck of the ship and he was able to retrieve the ships logs.

He will show them the ships logs, they are open on his desk.
  "11th of May.. We recieved visitors today from the Hands of Baele, they wanted to renegotiate hunting grounds. We took them on as scrub crew, they seem a sour lot, but very famliar about ship."


I was never able to run down the whole crew of the Hands of Baele, but I was able to catch the few I could in the various weirs of Thunder.

The second time was during the defense of the city. He was trying to get the western tower operational and she had shown up as Salty Elisa, and had sung the blues out of the tower, and he was able to retake the tower and repell the rest of the fleet from the harbor.

He is delighting to talk the history and topology of Thunder Port, including the older ruin the imperial capital was built on. He has some rubbings he took off Fat Rat Island in an unknown language.

He has read everything that hes been able to glean about Shanty and has connected her enough to Nissa to know when to stop looking. In particular, if he's asked about the blues, he appears confused for a while and then moves on in another direction.
