# Master Jet Lakoizh

Jet is impulsive and just. His long friendship with Sarl has also rubbed off on him, when it comes to making considered decisions. He has curtailed corruption within the Silverbloods and has built them into a loyal, organized unit, despite their backstabby backgrounds.

Returning the the Empire, he has gained a large amount of support. Many of the [Silverbloods](/t/the_silver_king.md) are from the Empire, second sons and lost legacies, but many powerful in back in the Empire.
