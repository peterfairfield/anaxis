## Option Harold Bols

An unstoppable force with a happy leap in his step. He has a lot on his plate, and he needs that plate cleaned and put back on the shelf.

### [The Iron Gate](/l/the_iron_gate.md)

The main front door of the city. This is Bols’ headquarters. Some prisoners have things to say:

1.  A caught book thief Porter: “I’m ready to talk”, he can tell you about the next moves of the Society.
2.  A pirate goes wild and escapes.
3.  A prisoner who has seen a lot of people recently A lot of traffic by his cell.
4.  Assault on the Iron Gate, with Bols in command. This is during a panic, jailbreak, or other crisis. Valuable prisoners are probably kept within, or the Regent Yung himself.
5.  Sarl will try to charm, buy off pursuaede them from engaging in the crisis, or jump them if they are intent on following through.

### [Tearer Training](/f/the_tearers.md)

The Tearers -- Often Citizen bands hired for a particular effort, usually civic and violent in nature. There are glass, clay, and paper Tearers, the last a use of mustering for militia. Glass – water related, or higher paying jobs. Clay, typically delivery or escort. Paper for large-scale jobs (public works) or wartime.  They are largely built of the hill people surrounding the city, ancient enemies, the dogs of the city. There are bands of well-trained Tearers for firefighting and mustering. Bells ringing triple-peals throughout the city signal a mustering.

### [Intake/Registration](/s/intake.md)

When he can get his hands on them, he want them to do a lot of things, in kinda an order:

1.  Get registered, give a name, get a chunk of clay.
2.  Get recruited (badass fight scene)
    1.  Investigate a bunch of missing books from the Bard’s Library on Broadstreet. 
    2.  Go tell those lads that if they are going to pluck a pheasant, they’d better get a pheasant plucker. (he throws the Pall Bears some fresh meat)
3.  He is on the lookout for undead rumors and nasty stuff coming down. Find it!
4.  Take the Runestone and find out about the nasty stuff. He wants trophies, or whole corpses. Tainted pirates, diseased corpses, all these are welcome as well.
5.  If he feels that the Moshkans are getting out of hand, he’ll intervene peacefully, and make diplomatic overtures
6.  He wants you to go after something big.
7.  He is rounding up people and you are helping or on that list?

### [Host Coverup](/f/the_host.md)

At this point, the Host will intervene and try to confiscate all of their evidence. If they resist the Tearers, they will be arrested, hopefully for something else they have done. If they allow themselves to be arrested, they can appeal to Bols, and if they manage to get an audience with him, but he’s likely to try to get them to do another  job.

### [The Moveable Library](/s/university_library#moving.md)

While the Natural College Library is going into an expansion phase, probably taking in content from the two other damaged libraries in town. Lord Saxon wants them to help move certain texts securely. Also helping is Bols and Ava Gavin, if she has been reconciled to Saxon, or perhaps Captain Buckfest if they need a boat.

### [The Rock](/l/the_rock.md)

Bols has picked up Sarl, who was acting of a go-between for Mushussu, and has found out since the discovery of the forgeries that Mushussu (via Sarl) was using the Broken Leg as a deaddrop location. Sarl also had chalk, vellum and a flask of oil on him. Jobs might be:

1.  Go and asses the viabillity of a defunct keep or tower as a base of operations. A large subterrain space would be great.

### [Kars Island](/l/kars_island.md)

Forests hold sacred wood and even more importantly: spices and drugs. Bols is used to dealing with the locals respectfully but unknowns with extreme extradition. If there is a lull on Kars, Bols can show up and start searching door to door, with a band of Tearers. He has come overland from the other end of the iron road, and may meet them there, coming the opposite way. If the islands marines show up, they will halt in awe and Bols will move to assist them. Hiram's sailors he has little time for, but he WILL insist on registering all of the unregistered crew among them.

Hiram will not be happy about Bols’ presence, but will try to move quickly to put the blame on the crones and frame their actions in the most dangerous light. They have made an infernal pact.

### [The Harbor Light](/l/the_harbor_light.md)

Showdown between DeVerre and Philos, The Clerk. Bols is trying to prove he has the right to search the houses for Hatchaxel. DeVerre has to correct him, given the status of Orphanage “Keep no blood” qualifies as a Hospital, and outside 3 miles of the city.

*   Bols has probably searched several houses by the time they stop him.
*   Philos will interject that the canal allows a border search exception could allow them to search in hot pursuit.
*   Bols will swat him down, he will mutter something to the tune of “and by the way, we have a probable suspicion that there is heroin in transit, by some ancient code or other, so they do have the right to examine the bowels of the islanders.
*   DeVerre will point out that they are no longer, but if they could all get on with it, they could search the island together. In good faith, he will invite Bols to come with him.

### [During Riot/Invasion](/r/riot.md)

1.  During crisis: there is a big fight here, it would be nice to have a map. Perhaps the cards are map tiles, with sigils on them. The fight should threaten the life or end the life of a close ally (Bols, for instance). Here are some examples
    1.  Transporting Prisoners – a cart of prisoners, perhaps the town council, maybe some enemies of the city?
    2.  If Ava is part of the prisoners or conflict, she can tell them about the state of the attack that is going on. There are 2 attacks, the big loud one and the quieter one. She knows more about the big loud one and its characteristics.
    3.  A total mistaken identity that is going to cause mayhem.

### [Acceptance Ceremoy](/p/lord_bols.md)

An Acceptance ceremony, where a poor kid gets their acceptance from Natural College. When the Cursors and sent though, Bols will clear the streets, and if the players succeed in helping him prevent a stampede will get Tearer-points.

### [The Flint House](/l/flint_house.md)

They will run into Bors, and after ceding neutral territory. He will tell them that he’s worried about his superiors in the Host, and he is at a loss whom to trust.

1.  “Option Tyranny” Bols tells them that there are rumors that the Iron Gate is compromised, and there is a ton of powerful movement around his superiors. 
2.  He suspects it is more like favors for information.
3.  A suspect in custody for trial (probably someone like Hatchaxel, Surl, or Porter), but there has been strange security changes.
4.  The security of Beowulf Castle has been tightened.
