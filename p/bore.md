### The Pattern

Whenever they first are arrested for anything bigish: Alain Bore would like to talk about the Pattern. He regrets their treatment heretofore from the Host, apologizes for his underlings behavior and openly berates his superiors. The Executor notices that you are from out of town and wants you input on the pattern of in particular the lost Ship. The attacks over the years from a ghost ship that hits every 50 years. He thinks you might be off that ship.

This is just a side project, he will get back to his real job unless he can tell them anything about a site they want invesigated, infiltrated, whathaveyou, those guys are bored, and I might have a job for you right now if you've shown certain skills. 

> Did you fireball my men? Show me that again.

> Also, sometime he might mention something about the Lady of the Depths, he will then try to get them to help him take on an investigation in that arena.

>Ok, back to the pattern for a sec, look at these charts of the Islands of Kess & Keers.

> Parting shot: Have you talked to the Madman?


### More Bore

In this case, he’d like the Bindstone, which has proof of the contract between himself and [Roma](/p/roma.md), or perhaps something as important. He does want to bring Saad in to appear for trial, but knows that he might need to remain in the countryside. He does want to bring him back into the fold, and possibly rehire the entire Grey Clerics, if he can find something for them to do. He’s working on it. Once he gets a Ship of the Line made, he can crew it with Grey Clerics. In the meantime, he will give them a brig.


#### The Story of Roma and Bore

They saved each other during a crisis. Bore wanted to get married, so she did, but forced him to sign a prenup, giving her essentially nothing. They cannot find the prenup in their records, so they’ve come to the library to find a way out of this.

This is a bit of how it went down: [Roma](/p/roma.md) had inherited a huge amount of money from her parent’s land, it was completely full of bitumen.

### Executor

Most people know that it's "big shot", but there aren't a lot of famous ones. Seems like a new title. Some project between the naval colleges and Host.

He's very young for the position, but it came up with a wave of retirements. For many in this rocky political terrian, Bore is their shelter from the storm, holding the city together. He will not hesitate to detain them if he needs them, or to search their stuff, with his agents or just himself.

Executor Bore

Who is innocent of stealing the books, so knows for sure it wasn’t him. Iis going to come down on everyone like a ton of bricks. He is going to make the most of this bookhunt, grabbing books he wants, executing political rivals, cleaning house upstairs and downstairs, with a pile of burning books in the middle.


The Pattern
Bore (as always) think these thefts have a pattern, once he hears of the book the Finders claim to be missing: [The Seawurm](/l/the_seawurm.md)’s Ship’s Logs.


Bore 
Anytime they touch him, they will be recruited by Anax Shoe – a High Tearer who works for Bore.

and the Firest Forest. He will feed them some information, and only if they make an effort.
The givers of green are healers, with the Finders, somehow
The Standing Stones are all over the Necropolis, and parts of the Chippies are built on the Standing Stones.
The criminals in the city are retrained into the legions. 
People have been disappearing. There appears to be a pattern, and the Givers of Green seem to be really implicated, if he can lead them to their own conclusions, the better.
He wants to know what the Kracken is looking for.
He wants to know anything about the Natural College he can find.
