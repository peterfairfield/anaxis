#### The Story of Roma and Bore

They saved each other during a crisis. Bore wanted to get married, so she did, but forced him to sign a prenup, giving her essentially nothing. They cannot find the prenup in their records, so they’ve come to the library to find a way out of this.

This is a bit of how it went down: Roma had inherited a huge amount of money from her parent’s land, it was completely full of bitumen.
