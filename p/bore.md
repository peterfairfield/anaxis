#### The Story of Roma and Bore

They saved each other during a crisis. Bore wanted to get married, so she did, but forced him to sign a prenup, giving her essentially nothing. They cannot find the prenup in their records, so they’ve come to the library to find a way out of this.

This is a bit of how it went down: [Roma](/p/roma) had inherited a huge amount of money from her parent’s land, it was completely full of bitumen.

### Executor

Most people know that it's "big shot", but there aren't a lot of famous ones. Seems like a new title. Some project between the naval colleges and Host.

He's very young for the position, but it came up with a wave of retirements. For many in this rocky political terrian, Bore is their shelter from the storm, holding the city together. He will not hesitate to detain them if he needs them, or to search their stuff, with his agents or just himself.
