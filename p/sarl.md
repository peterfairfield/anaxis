Sarl Agab Thornshield

Tribune of Lagash, brother to Sire Jan.

He has been instrumental in keeping [Silar](/p/silar.md) from dissapation and medicating him for his madness. He is worried about Silar's death, and has been keeping tabs on [Nilfar](/p/niflar.md).

The minds of the masses are open to Sarl. He is constantly writing a notebook, which may be published in various forms as "Thoughts" or "Meditations". Everything is interpretation, the will is paramount. Self-control and self-moderation are common themes.
