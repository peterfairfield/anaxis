Esme Thornshield  & The Exploding Town
Warband leader of the Prince’s Wolves. Her home town exploded and there was only one survivor. She is sure the Host is behind the attacks, and sends them to the Iron Gate to see what information they can gather. Also, there was a survivor of the explosion, being held by the Moska, and she wants to spring the survivor who is kept at the Bog Dogs. 
“This won’t be boring”.

The Bog Dogs
The will have a tough time breaking in, but with some contacts and moving the right pieces, they should be able to at least get access to the survivor. Esme might come along with them in disguise. Otherwise, they are to deliver her to Esme’s estate on Sheep Island. Either way, the Sappers catch up with them.

The Siege of Sheep Island
Two words: white phosphorus fire. The Sappers light the place up and send a fireboat to shore. The Clinkers run up the beach, forcing a melee, veterans and rogues. The bring mastiffs, a ton of them. There are some ancient blooded enemies of the Thornshields, and band called Blood Gang.

The whole wood catches in fire. The attack is more than overwhelming, it obviously involves several coordinated groups, a difficult-to-put-together mismash. Someone with very deep pockets indeed. The Blood Gang is out there to kill Esme, if they rescue her, the prisoner is re-captured, otherwise, they bear the brunt of an insane amount of Tearers before they slink off.

Falstaff will arrive and tell them how they can counter-track the prisoner. This might be because he had been approached, he discloses as much as he trusts them with. But they can track the prisoner. It is a tearer stronghold, the Breighton Brothers. They will have some work cut out for them. 

Throw me in Honey
The Brothers are the most closeted bunch you’ve ever met, think Proudboys who are allowed circlejerks. You probably *have* to kill these guys. For me. If they do so, Bore will have had time to get in and out and destroy evidence. If they get done too quickly, he will send someone to show up with a group of soldiers and wipe the place. If they are really sneaky sneaky they can get some compromat on Bore.



What does compromat on Bore look like? Well, for one, he was working for the Host.
