Sargent Horne

He is an old Sargent. Dirty as the day is long, absolutely indispensable, he works for everyone and has a price for anything. He only works for the Ymil more than anyone else because he is afraid of them. He is sweet on Roma and works his tush off to impress her.

Lady Horne and the Painting of the Windfinder

He is of [Chondros](/f/chondros.md), a brisk [Danoi pirate](/f/danoi.md).

There is a exhibition of art at the Fleet School Keep, and the Lady Horne has invited the public to come and view them. The pieces are from most of the finest artists, living and dead. They depict the history of Eshar, from the fall of the old city (now [Tell Kur](/l/tell_kalam.md)) , the drowned city [Eabakzu](/l/eabakzu.md), and the city of the Sun. Then: the Windfinder coming into the city in tatters, and the coming of the Danoi and the Silvermen. Lady Horne is of an old Esherite blood, he is her cousin, but a very different kind of Horne.
