# Nate Hound

Son of Lord Saxon, Half-finder Danoi. He is a captain in the Bulls, graduating from House Beowulf. He has fallen in with the more unsavory elements of the Eschar underground. He has attempted to join the Moshka and BRH, but his association with his father has crippled his efforts in those direction.

## The Trial
He is friends with Hatchaxel, and was there during the Rat Hunt. 

## The Host
There are many allies within the Host who believe that Nate is the future of the Host. He has largely abdicated the positions thrust on him, perferring the company of lowlives and crimminals.
