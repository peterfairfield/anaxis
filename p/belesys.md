## Belesys

Danoi governer of the Empire's closest providence. He is largely a figurehead and "familiar face" for the Empire. He is aware of the delicate situation he is in, and will probably go with whomever will give him the best chance of living.

He is a hedonist and a sop. He will accept single to the death combat at any time.

He can be won over by the ship building and the bitumen ships. He is interested immediately in bitumen. Then, as a afterthought, he will betray [Iorek](/p/iorek.md):

"I regret to inform you that my associate, the Wizard Iorek, has contracted a disease of his people, and has decided to cast all reason to the wind. He has been abducting and traffiking in the people of the Media. He must be stopped. Here is the map to the cave where he collects these slaves."

"I would ask the University's opinion in the matter of leaving the Media to assault a University Fellow's research tower... But I prefer to do it this way!"

"I wish to give you what my father gave me. Everything I needed to do my task and the answer to what the task was."

"I do wish for freedom, even at the expense of my own. The City will allow the enforcement of [Defender](/f/the_defenders.md) law to all citizens, and I will await the orders of the king."

If he makes it out of the fall of Lakash alive, he will become an incredible asset and a genius of military strategy.

He specializes in siege weaponry and arming and training units for a bit, but will soon take his place at the front of the next big fight they get into.
