# King Pyre

Leader of the assault on 

He wants to meet their king, when he mistook some professors for ambassadors, they said something and he immediately moved on Silver Mountain. Fallstaff reminds you now how much you need the [CoTM](/c/mind.md).

He is now intent on freeing the mountain, once he has discovered that the volcanoes are going to go off. He sends his army to Ahshura.  He and his team of Hadrad then head into the heart of the volcano.

## [Professor Iorek](/p/iorek.md) 

He will tell the story thusly, and hopefully pre-posthumonously: encounter with the Hadrad

## The First Hatchling of the King

Once he has bathed in the reignited fires of Silver Mountain, He comes forth declaring that the Messanger of the King is coming very soon, so they should be prepared! He brings nickle iron, silver, and gold immesurable. These events the founding of the College of the Mind could coincide exactly at the same time. Parson is worried about the effects on the economy of so much gold. He does know about the gold-hungry Hadrad Empire is on the point of attacking. He does also know of the coming of the Black Queen. "My tentacles are like hair? I Guess? I'm into it, by the way?"

> Perhaps Parson hires them for this one? And he comes along? An Escort quest -- uikes.

> At the same time, the College of the Mind will quickly find out where the people who are shielded are? They recruit the Hospitallers to start to help. Clerics going around casting detect thoughts on people? Standard procedure. When they find Parson, they will probably try to arrest him. Again? or is this part of what escalates a friendly visit into a full out throw down?

> Why can't Bahamut do it by himself at that point? He hasn't hatched. He a sky god.

His Seconds:
 - Undeth -- probably going to stop him. Paladin
 - Sorcel -- will certainly try to stop him. Wizard
 - Kranti -- Has his back no matter what. Assassin + whatever hurts worse. Def a bit of Ranger fighter rogue
