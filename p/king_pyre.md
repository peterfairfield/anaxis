# King Pyre

He wants to meet their king, when he mistook some professors for ambassadors, they said something and he immediately moved on Silver Mountain. Fallstaff reminds you now how much you need the [CoTM](/c/mind.md).

He is now intent on freeing the mountain, once he has discovered that the volcanoes are going to go off. He sends his army to Ahshura.  He and his team of Hadrad then head into the heart of the volcano.

Professor [Iorek](/p/iorek.md) will tell the story thusly, an hopefully posthumonously: 

He was trying to find out what staved off the curse after his beloved and her family died of the black, but his son survived. He'd been trying to find out how to pass the blood though to blood. This bound them back to their animal forms. 

If they are not able to wring this confession from him, Fallstaff can later, in a more pitiful if not humorous scene:

You can start as an interrogated prisoner, and creschendo toward the end.

"Before you kill me there is something more important than either of our lives I must tell you!"

> He was a very tall man, clad in steel mail finer than I have ever seen. It moved like rough cloth and covered his neck. It was dyed or stainded or powder-coated in something that made it really red. In his hands he held a helmet of horns, which he sat down and bid me and Erwin to sit next to. When he motioned, I could see that could see that there were 15 more tall figures all clad in green... And so I sat. He sat then and asked me: "Do you know why we are here?" -- I said it couldn't be all that bad, with trade and whatnot and how's about the higher learnin' and all Que Lorisumpisuemus he's talkin' Urchar. He askes me about the Pacts and I tells him some things he didn't know and pretty quick he's sent his army, (cause there was more than 16) back North, but he's put on his hat. Run away!"

Then, because this guy is such a jerk he always keeps something back:
"And then he and his 5 generals gathered. I thought at first they were generals. But I realize now that I'd taken the badge of reds vs greens vs blacks as ranks: Red was commanders? Blacks were scouts, Greens were heavies.

But.. that wasn't how it worked. The ranks kinda followed those lines, but the colors didn't really mean anything at all -- there was no rank difference between them.

But they kept separated from the others. I was with that army for 5 hours while they got on the kinda horseflesh you'd shiv two biddies for. 

Well, then I figured as much, and then they all took off.

And so I think you should and so do you?

You think you've figured me out! I'm a bad guy! Look at what I've learned from this, then decide if you want to kill me! Let me be on trial!

This will be a particularily sweet moment if they are using Aunt Agnus or her saltboxes, when she sails into the room or (if they bring him back) into the courtbench. Or if they bring him back, Fallstaff. Maybe, every time they use the spell, he is there somehow, in the background, hidden like an octopus, watching in the waters. "I don't think it's my fault, that this is where I live?" The minds reach out and follow their prey.

His eyes snap open, and hope quickens his lips:

"There she is, my dark lady! How're you, Auntie? Did I run an rum game?"

yes -- and no

"Well, I have tucked away behind my ear? What is this? OH!"

And the cowbird lands on your shoulder. It's name is Chill.

"Oh and it's name is Chill, goodnight, sweetheart, I still believe in you!"

If any Aunt is nearby, she can render him to the abyss.

This guy filibusters, beatboxes, tells his life story, he rebuilds a D&D campaign, he sharadazes it until they finally trap his brain. This might be how they Meat Aunt Agnus for nicers the second time, and establish a relationship. If she helps them escape and peg this fuckmonkey, 

## The First Hatchling of the King

Once he has bathed in the reignited fires of Silver Mountain, He comes forth declaring that the Messanger of the King is coming very soon, so they should be prepared! He brings nickle iron, silver, and gold immesurable. These events the founding of the College of the Mind could coincide exactly at the same time. Parson is worried about the effects on the economy of so much gold. He does know about the gold-hungry Hadrad Empire is on the point of attacking. He does also know of the coming of the Black Queen. "My tentacles are like hair? I Guess? I'm into it, by the way?" 

> Meanwhile:
> If the Dwarves haven't managed to get the Wheels moving, then the mines will be flooded with lava and completely ruined, ya jerks.
>
> Perhaps Parson hires them for this one? And he comes along? An Escort quest -- uikes.
>
> At the same time, the College of the Mind will quickly find out where the people who are shielded are? They recruit the Hospitallers to start to help. Clerics going around casting detect thoughts on people? Standard procedure. When they find Parson, they will probably try to arrest him. Again? or is this part of what escalates a friendly visit into a full out throw down?
>
> Why can't Bahamut do it by himself at that point? He hasn't hatched. He a sky god.

## The Red

His Seconds:
 - Undeth -- probably going to stop him. Paladin
 - Sorcel -- will certainly try to stop him. Wizard
 - Kranti -- Has his back no matter what. Assassin + whatever hurts worse. Def a bit of Ranger fighter rogue
