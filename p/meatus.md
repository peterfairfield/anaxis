## Scibere Maws Meatus


#### [Bard’s Library](/l/bards_library.md), corner of Scholar’s Hall and Broadstreet

Music history, musical instruction, also has a lot of books on all other subjects. The book that has been taken is “Historical Geo. Charts 113-189”, two entire shelves of books. The librarians can also tell them about the other major book theft in town: A crypt at the [Observatory](/p/the_observatory.md) has been broken into and looted. They don’t know anything about why the heavy involvement of the Theatre.

[Beek Rake Hats](/f/beef_rake_hats.md)

Scibere Meatus, who also works as a chef at the Beef Rake Hats. He is also a martial trainer for St. Andreas. He can become large, he has two modes IN and OUT. 

He knows that the [Observatory Library](/l/observatory.md) is under the protection of [St. Andreas](/f/st_andreas.md) and they will be looking into it, and would likely be capable of accepting help if approached in the right way. If, however Bore wants someone to knock heads with, he’ll find good company. They might be able to find out from him that several newcomers have been coming to the library, but no one of any particular note.
