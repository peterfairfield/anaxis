Dean Saxon

Lord Saxon is Dean of Hospital School. He also is a fellow of Natural College, also President of the Absurd in Darker Faire. The Natural College Library is going into an expansion phase, probably taking in content from the two other damaged libraries in town. He wants them to help move certain texts securely. Also helping is Bols and Ava Gavin, if she has been reconciled to the Dean, or Captain Buckfest if they need a boat.
