# Niflar Halfshield

## Boxer

Chief in-exile of the [Silvermen](/f/the_silvermen.md). Currently working as a ring-fighter pit-fighter at The Beef Rake Hats. They kinda like him, and haven’t tried to get him killed, seriously. They don’t really know his position in the Erimesh, but they know something is up with him. 

````
If the party befriends him, he may ask them to send a message to his half brother Gloryshield.

### Tel Kur

When the mines have a [complete breakdown](/e/king_pyre.md) and Eschar sends someone to find out about it.

Everyone from Eshar thinks that the disruption at Tell Kur is Gloryshield, who has protested them using the mines at Tell Kur, as they are sacred ground to his people. This is not the case, and Niflar will protest his brother's innocence to the player.
