# Ahsa Roma

### [Names](#hidden){#names}
Oly Bae, Natasha, 

### [Kars Island](/p/kars)

Asha has a deal with the Inner Circle of the [Green](/f/green). 
Bore’s experiment and Roma’s to clean up, a nice [Fellowship] ceremony might clear things up.

### [Hector Yung](/p/yung)

### [Scibere Meatus](/p/meatus)

If the players want to go back to Bard’s Library and use this information to narrow the list down, they can talk to Meatus. 

Meatus tells them that Porter (or and Edo impersonating him) is in the archives at this time, as he was given permission from Roma to investigate. They find a dead librarian, and all hell breaks loose. They find the next step in the bowels of the Library. The librarian has a page from Kessler’s book gripped in its fist? The floors beneath them are blown up.

**Why did Roma want to have someone follow Kessler? How did she find out? What does she think of Meatus?**

They could as well be against the University Library. There are two that  Roma suspects of being bad actors, the Curates Olaratmp and Glaveltmp. They have worked at the University Library for many many years, and they've had the job of preservation and transport of artefacts for the archives.

### [Sargent Horne](/p/sargent)

He is an old Sargent. Dirty as the day is long, absolutely indispensable, he works for everyone and has a price for anything. He only works for the Ymil more than anyone else because he is afraid of them. He is sweet on Roma and works his tush off to impress her. He's also known as Bosun, down at the docks. There isn't anyone he can't make friends with.

### [The Stolen Texts](/t/the_stolen_texts)

The major texts are taken out by the bulldozers. They only came to smash, not to grab. This rubble can be reconstructed to find the life blood of information. They might meet Roma. 

“You know, the advantage of my line of work is, people can never be sure that it might not be the case that… 
 ... are working for me or with me? or not?” 
 
 What is written and recorded about her movements. She is new chaos leaking off her.


“I’m a spy for the biggest, most nefarious organization you can imagine, by like 1 billion times, or some big big number. Sorry I’m babbling. You must understand, that is one damn good cover (wink).”

“Do you know who you work for. Maybe: do you know who you work for?”

“Are you insulted by the question?”

“I think we might be able to work together” Iron. Iron until 500 years ago we had iron. There is an Iron Gate to the city. We were pulling up raw nickel iron from a vein, and that built the steel of the city. But then came cheaper iron, found everywhere. Cheap iron. Anyone with cash could summon an unstoppable army, and oh look someone did. I’m working on behalf of the people who would try to make things more pleasant for everyone.”

“Speaking of which, gotta work, I’ll see you guys in my offtime, you seen like a real nice bunch, but gotta, gotta go…”

“Call me Queen, I like it!”

The choice in the city is whether to unite the reactive elements (the Ymil vs the Witches, and yes she is working for both), Bore has just been promoted to President of the War College, and the boys were feeling punchy and decided to have a Rat Hunt. Bore has court-martialed all of the middle command with extreme vigor and has replaced them from the Society. He has done this with a really old rule of the city, and is expected to be challenged in court. He is also going through a divorce with the Roma.

### [Ram's Shelf](/l/rams_shelf)

Roma is there, and can purr them into talking to some of the townsfolk who saw what actually happened. This appears to be:

"Have you ever wondered why all house mistresses have the same demeanor? It's because it's easier to sub them out, you see."

"I do actually work here, occasionally. And the clientle are very, very talkative. But usually I just come here for the vacation and mountain air."

There are some people who might be willing to talk.

Niama can tell them: 
 * Hysterics, “The Shrine of the Moon” and “The Bishop's Hide”
 * There is a really hot-headed Prince on the premises.
 * And he might start murdering people.
 * Edo Rian has been destroying evidence. Burning a lot of paper.
Eventually, Rian will have to go with the desires of his heart: the transference to werewolf without danger to his life, and loyalty to his mistress in the upcoming battle with Aunt Agnus, who is coming with her sahagin army to put the Kraken down, before it destroys the world.

The Shrine of the Moon
They meet these groups in a wild concert of violence, they might be dancing? Posturing?
Jat and his gang of Silverbloods. These are lone wolves who have long been tired of the councils and the succession. Jat will deconvene the shrine if he is put into power.
There aren’t a lot of Silverblood family here, but they are quite quick, like weasels.
The Moska who are coming to pay their respects to their great friend, the spirit of the thing that is going to kill them all.
The Broken Ones – A band of Hill people with carnival like deformities, but they become something beautiful when they shift. Half are Moska. Roma is their leader.
The New in Towns – Fresh Meat – New Demons – these are recently lead by Fred, many of them work at the Natural College.
The Spirit Itself
The Prince’s Wolves – This guy is too cool to not be a main Character. Oh, this is Vamarm Silar Gloryshield, and he just crowned himself king. Silar will say “Well shoot, I’ve dabbled in fictions no more complicated than this”

Aunt Agnus
When they meet her, she is unfortunately storming the shrine with a spider army of craboids. She is in a bad MLM and she needs a way out. She might be the only one in this scenario who can make the connection between the Kraken and the College. Agnus will move to take out what she sees as an element too close: Edo Nain. She blames him for brokering this alliance. Her primary goal is the dissolution of relationships between the Silverbloods and the University. Edo feels the same way, and they are on the lookout for each other.

The Spirit holy cow this needs to be something from Aunt Agnus’s past. What is she (Aboleth)? How did she grow up? Was it rough? She is an old brain-eater. She knows her bread and butter. Aunt Elisa eats the past. The Kraken eats stories.

Edo Nain
He will draw them back into the past, when a Danoi army stood waiting to fight for the Blood Throne. They had marched from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and they brought with them 13,000 hoplites. The mountain passes had been well repaired and there had been no-one to accost them as they crossed to the City. They faced the armies of the Hill People, he saw their determination, their might, their paths, there they fought the Hill People. 

The Garden Path
You meet Jat and Roma, arguing but ultimately agreeing to share power when the others submit. Roma doesn’t believe this lie for a second, but she is watching for this to play out.

They are met with in force by Fred and the New Pups. Things are going to get a little tense. When the party shows up, Jat make take the opportunity to accuse Roma of stabbing him in the back and attack. Or he might be talked down, if he thinks there is still time to get further public. If the Game is back on, the Primals will now hit, otherwise, it’s just Agnus’s crew, with everything she can muster off The Shudder Cudder, a newly made ancient sea folk sloop.

The reward for brokering peace and getting the succession worked out is 1 week of foreknowledge.  +1 CHA The chaos is deep and tasty.

They hoist sail, and go howling on longships after the sloop, and they are attacked by pirates.
