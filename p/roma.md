# Ahsa Roma

### [Names](#hidden){#names}
Oley Bae, Natasha, 

### [Kars Island](/l/kars_island.md)

Asha has a deal with the Inner Circle of the [Green](/f/green) "**This**: is tooo cool. What if it is pretty big? how big does it get?".md). 
Bore’s experiment and Roma’s to clean up, a nice [Fellowship] ceremony might clear things up.

### [Hector Yung](/p/yung.md)

### [Scibere Meatus](/p/meatus.md)

If the players want to go back to Bard’s Library and use this information to narrow the list down, they can talk to Meatus. 

Meatus tells them that [Porter](/p/porter.md) (or and Edo impersonating him) is in the archives at this time, as he was given permission from Roma to investigate. They find a dead librarian, and all hell breaks loose. They find the next step in the bowels of the Library. The librarian has a page from Kessler’s book gripped in its fist? The floors beneath them are blown up.

**Why did Roma want to have someone follow [Kessler](/p/kessler.md)? How did she find out? What does she think of Meatus?**

They could as well be against the University Library. There are two that  Roma suspects of being bad actors, the Curates Olara#tmp and Glavel#tmp. They have worked at the University Library for many many years, and they've had the job of preservation and transport of artefacts for the archives.

### [Sargent Horne](/p/sargent.md)

He is an old Sargent. Dirty as the day is long, absolutely indispensable, he works for everyone and has a price for anything. He only works for the Ymil more than anyone else because he is afraid of them. He is sweet on Roma and works his tush off to impress her. He's also known as Bosun, down at the docks. There isn't anyone he can't make friends with.

### [The Stolen Texts](/t/the_stolen_texts.md)

The major texts are taken out by the bulldozers. They only came to smash, not to grab. This rubble can be reconstructed to find the life blood of information. They might meet Roma. 

“You know, the advantage of my line of work is, people can never be sure that it might not be the case that… 
 ... are working for me or with me? or not?” 
 
 What is written and recorded about her movements. She is new chaos leaking off her.


“I’m a spy for the biggest, most nefarious organization you can imagine, by like 1 billion times, or some big big number. Sorry I’m babbling. You must understand, that is one damn good cover (wink).”

“Do you know who you work for. Maybe: do you know who you work for?”

“Are you insulted by the question?”

“I think we might be able to work together” Iron. Iron until 500 years ago we had iron. There is an [Iron Gate](/l/the_iron_gate.md) to the city. We were pulling up raw nickel iron from a vein, and that built the steel of the city. But then came cheaper iron, found everywhere. Cheap iron. Anyone with cash could summon an unstoppable army, and oh look someone did. I’m working on behalf of the people who would try to make things more pleasant for everyone.”

“Speaking of which, gotta work, I’ll see you guys in my offtime, you seen like a real nice bunch, but gotta, gotta go…”

“Call me Queen, I like it!”

The choice in the city is whether to unite the reactive elements (the [Ymil](/f/ymil.md) vs the Witches, and yes she is working for both), [Bore](/p/bore.md) has just been promoted to President of the [War College](/f/war_college.md), and the boys were feeling punchy and decided to have a Rat Hunt. Bore has court-martialed all of the middle command with extreme vigor and has replaced them from the Society. He has done this with a really old rule of the city, and is expected to be challenged in court. He is also going through a divorce with the Roma.


### Hello, I'm Numea Roma

The first time the party needs to clean up something pronto, they bring in a pro: She knows a few things, but they are very dangerous. She wields them for maximum carnage. For you:
 * The phases of the Moon corresponds to the ship attacks. The Keepers of the Moon have not been helpful, she could use someone higher up in the Upper Halls, which they might have made contact through their work with Kirkhalls.
 * She will not work directly with the Host, as most of her contacts/contracts are directly under Host persecution. 
 * She appears to be in love with Allan.
 * She is terrified of Bees.
 * She has been studying bones, she has been noticing bones of a people who have lived here before.


#### Handlers
> **Moska**: Mal the Tongue, he looks like the witcher, only a lot worse.

> **Navy**: [Lady Horne](/p/lady_horne.md), of course.

> **Ymil**: Professor [Shawn Fallstaff](/p/fallstaff.md)


### [Ram's Shelf](/l/rams_shelf.md)

This is a well-to-do district associated with university professors and higher-kirkhall prelates.

Roma is there, and can purr them into talking to some of the townsfolk who saw what actually happened. This appears to be:

> "Have you ever wondered why all house mistresses have the same demeanor? It's because it's easier to sub them out, you see."

> "I do actually work here, occasionally. And the clientle are very, very talkative. But usually I just come here for the vacation and mountain air."

> There are some people who might be willing to talk, in particular one of the younger clans: The Prince's Wolves. She is actually going to paint them in rose colors, as she blames them for her loss of position.

Niama can tell them: 
 * Hysterics, “The Shrine of the Moon” and “The Bishop's Hide”
 * There is a really hot-headed [Prince](/p/tyrejere.md) on the premises.
 * And he might start murdering people.
 * His name is [Silar Gloryshield](/p/silar.md) 
 * Edo Rian has been destroying evidence. Burning a lot of paper.
Eventually, Rian will have to go with the desires of his heart: the transference to werewolf without danger to his life, and loyalty to his mistress in the upcoming battle with Aunt Agnus, who is coming with her sahagin army to put the Kraken down, before it destroys the world.


### [Aunt Agnus](/p/aunt_agnus.md)

When they meet her, she is unfortunately storming the shrine with a spider army of craboids. She is in a bad MLM and she needs a way out. She might be the only one in this scenario who can make the connection between the Kraken and the College. Agnus will move to take out what she sees as an element too close: Edo Nain. She blames him for brokering this alliance. Her primary goal is the dissolution of relationships between the Silverbloods and the University. Edo feels the same way, and they are on the lookout for each other.

The Spirit holy cow this needs to be something from Aunt Agnus’s past. What is she (Aboleth)? How did she grow up? Was it rough? She is an old brain-eater. She knows her bread and butter. Aunt Elisa eats the past. The Kraken eats stories. The ants pick up the rest, and the [ants pick up the rest](/r/rest.md)

### [Edo Nain](/p/nain.md)
He will draw them back into the past, when a Danoi army stood waiting to fight for the Blood Throne. They had marched from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and they brought with them 13,000 hoplites. The mountain passes had been well repaired and there had been no-one to accost them as they crossed to the City. They faced the armies of the Hill People, he saw their determination, their might, their paths, there they fought the Hill People. 

### [The Garden Path](/r/the_garden_path.md)

If they go to the meeting, no-one but the old-bloods will try to murder them. Sing them a [swan song](/r/swan_song.md).

### The Shrine of the Moon

They meet these groups in a wild concert of violence, they might be dancing? Posturing?

---

**Jat and his gang of Silverbloods.**

These are lone wolves who have long been tired of the councils and the succession. Jat will deconvene the shrine if he is put into power.

There aren’t a lot of Silverblood family here, but they are quite quick, like weasels. Some might be other well known [assassins](/a/assassins.md).

**The Broken Ones**
 A band of Hill people with carnival like deformities, but they become something beautiful when they shift. Half are Moska. Roma is their leader.

 The Moska The Moska are coming to pay their respects to their great friend, the spirit of the thing that is going to kill them all.

**The New in Towns**
 – Fresh Meat – New Demons – 
You've run into these guys before, but huh, no faces you recognise.  Roma usually reserved this for the dumbest of the dumb, and it usually kept them out of trouble, and still entertained: Ram's Shelf.

Typically, these guys are all brand new and running around like puppies.

Something has changed in their demeanor this year. these are recently lead by Fred, many of them work at the Natural College, if you have an eye for that.

You meet Jat and Roma, arguing but ultimately agreeing to share power when the others submit. He is a big fat lyre, his tunes obsequies, but his intentions murderous. If Roma joins, the rest of the packs will submit -- they don't have any unity. He may even point this out to Roma, to try and catch her in something, perhaps it's about how she ran off to the city, and only comes home for family ceremonies. He promises her half power, as defined in the laws ex ramis. And that's it, if she looks up those laws, she will regret kiling him. But at this point, it could go either way.

Roma doesn’t believe this lie for a second, but she is watching for this to [play out](/r/play_out.md)

They are met with in force by Fred and the New Pups. Things are going to get a little tense. When the party shows up, Jat make take the opportunity to accuse Roma of stabbing him in the back and attack. Or he might be talked down, if he thinks there is still time to get further public. If the Game is back on, the Primals will now hit, otherwise, it’s just Agnus’s crew, with everything she can muster off The Shudder Cudder, a newly made ancient sea folk sloop.

The reward for brokering peace and getting the succession worked out is 1 week of foreknowledge.  +1 CHA The chaos is deep and tasty.

They hoist sail, and go howling on longships after the sloop, and they are attacked by pirates.


### [The Spirit Itself](/p/raphael.md)


The Prince’s Wolves – This guy is too cool to not be a main Character. Oh, this is Vamarm Silar Gloryshield, and he just crowned himself king. Silar will say “Well shoot, I’ve dabbled in fictions no more complicated than this” He is the emissary, and he brings a message for the King. (is this some psy-ops? Roma cannot figure this guy out?)


The Tower of Aunt Agnus
Big Tentacles, oh my. The island has a lake, and the lake is deep. There are tentacles in the lake. A huge monster tree. It tries to eat them, in a friendly way. It smells so sweet and it sings so gently. The island seems really pleasant, suddenly there are motes of light and everything sounds like it is far away. You can somehow see better, see clearer. The aboleth enters your mind for the first time. Agnus asks you what you most desire. You know you must tell the truth.

This is when [Edo Nain](/p/nain.md) springs into action, if he’s still alive. He will mindblank them all with scrolls and then tells them to proceed as they wish. #TODO He will have the Spirit with him, if they let him have it, and maybe Option Bols, if he survived so far. Bols will meet Fred soon. That is going to be the tightest of bonds in the City, as it Changes. 

At the confrontation, if they can introduce to Agnus a solid connection within the Natural College, she will put off the war of succession. The seas can be at peace. It’ll be known as the 11 hours war. There was even a successful mutiny. Maybe the moon will come up. The Admiral’s College is in absolute uproar. Josriel is an Admiral and she will be running a squadrun of Host Ships to run them to ground, wherever they might be. This will come to be known as the First Fleet, as it is the first to go into the Moongate. When you go through, the boat is dumped upside down in the water, with you on the bottom. That’s about all. If the party is there, they get to meet the Sun King instead of Josriel. He will be swimming for his life off the Reed Island.

Aftermath: someone was bound to slip up. Either they know more about Roma, Bore, Agnus, or Nain after this, or Silar will notice something and give them a mission to check up on, because he’s a smart guy. There is the mystery of the ship and of the disappearance of Saxon and Gladhand’s fleet.
