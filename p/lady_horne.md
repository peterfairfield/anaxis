# Lady Horne

When she first meets them, Lady Horne will tell this story:

Once there was man named Strictler who lived at the Land of Large Flags. They say he built a boat without any iron in it, lashed together by the sinews of sea-beasts. He made it to the Iron Isles, we know because they marvelled at his boat when it arrived. He had built a proper sea-going ship from wood pegs and sinew, and they made a drawing of it. Then, from there he set out for what my people call the White Islands, or "Kassiteria" in our poetry. He ran into a storm and didn't make it. Do you know why his ship failed to make it, why the sailers say he wasn't able to sail for home?

Because my people build boats with a lot of rope, and the sinew of sea-beasts doesn't make very good rope at sea.

I am not an expert on rope. But there are people whom I trust that are. I do want to know what the spider's silk is like. I would also like to know how the ship was made.

If asked about the drawing: "That is silly of me, to have mentioned a drawing, without being able to immediately produce it. How about if you provide for a shark-filled evening that doesn't get anyone killed, I'll be sure to get you a copy of that drawing?"

## The Black Hammer
