 King Solen
 
 He first became a soldier, and fought in the human wars, and later in the Blood Empires. He then became a pirate king and established Lakash. He has never travelled to Eshar, as there is a bitterness there and grief that makes the place unapprochable, all of the lost knowledge of the lost world gathered as if in a tomb. He is too addicated to pain to allow himself to remember where to go. He thinks that what is happening to the greens is an exploitable resource instead of a final skin shedding. "do you think we could hang out in a bar while looking like a giant lizard all the time? Ever seen the seating conditions at the Opera?"

 He began to see the changes spread, and he saw the potential in the trapped refugees to build something -- shit

 He will do everything in his power to stay. They will not be able to pursuade him otherwise. The clearest enemies of the Empire are the Reds, but there is a cadre of the white, the Kegia, who are going to be a real problem.

 He helped the first White Dragons pupa emerge and kept them from being slain as witches. They form the core of his power, but he also has the widespread support of the other Black Dragons. 

 The Black Emporer. He will be devoted to Aunt Agnus and Undeth if they ever meet. He'll let her know how the assassination attempts went. Mostly they got him, and then he didn't die. And it was really painful while it happened, and once he lost all his hair. He really wants his catch-phrase to be "Sleep!". He is a font of information, and if there is a military, he's probably served in it and knows their commanders status and foibles.

 He will maintain his ambitions and black network, using his teleknisis. Once he meets porter, he will unfurl his role as the Proclaimer. How do I get all of the things to happen to Fred? And do they happen before or after the Sun King gets them? Is that beside the point? He's the return Captain, no?
