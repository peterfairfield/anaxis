  

Captain Buckfest  
Brings extra surl, with a huge floppy hat and oilskins. Covered in salt. He does not like pirates or cutters. He knows the sea, weather and salt. He has spoken to the madman, as he ferried him over from the island. He has also seen the ghost ship, but doesnâ€™t want to discuss it.

  

He likes knives and spirits. He hates the land, freshwater and rope. He has a sloop and a crew of 8 sailors.
