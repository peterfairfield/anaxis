The Rules as Written:

1. Go through the map, and try to get from one node to another node in as few leaps as possible. 
* If you get lost roll the die
* draw a card
* tunnel your way through!

The Rules: when you get to a certain point in the drawings, then you can select certain characters to kill and those to spare. There is a dimension of what is inherited from the absorption of one to the other.

They could as well be against the University Library. There are two that  Roma suspects of being bad actors, Olaratmp and Glaveltmp.


Core idea, people, places, story, scene (encounter could only be half an option). Time (from one to another). These is everything that is actually data coming into the machine. Each piece of data should be treated with respect, and allowed to build another dimension of the information. I should instantiate a model for each of these objects, leave no cross tables unstoried, placed or peopled. You can actually start a deck with just Story, and then add the others (they are all story) but as more cards get added, they can just expand in symbols. [Encounters(/r/encounters)] should maybe be triggered by DM fiat, if they fit the mood and power level of the players.

Go to your debriefing, following out up through being a double triple quad agent vs There are 1000000 souls on this sphere who have voted to intervene.

Only you remain. What is your vote?

The start: we got our own boat! Then the boat evolves throughout the campaign. A huge fleet of merchant ships that’s crashed into a moon. Then a trash heap piled on top. Something happens to earth and now everybody needs ships and ship parts.

“So you are the most irrisiteble person and no one and deny a direct request from your mouth, but may I persuade you…”

What we have developed is a nothing beam that kills everything it points at. The target may not die instantly, but they will die.

The one being that once you connect with it, you connect to the rest of the world (it’s observable world).

Ownership means able to impress my will upon it. Jarg Varg realizing that the dragon is his dragon.

The megaorganism that was born in the great wars was the blob of the nation states and where they stabbed at each other.

You have been the fighter that has fought and fought and never lost any fight. Do you want to play dnd rules? He’s still the fighter. Scalples at dawn? You up, me down.

Per class “background introductions” will be added.

Th guy who says, it was your job to lead us into battle to die, finally!

The third: that which will cling to you. You come to it, wanting your final battle, and it will make sure you are safe for as long as possible.

How do I monetize what I want to do?

How Dvarven trade is conducted: you steal from him, and he pays to get it back.

The guys downstream are trying to fake a technological hight they don’t have. With flash bangs, the greatest and newest armor they could buy. Everything. Magic? That comes from the top.

Well, there is someone who would help you out of this pretty pickle for a price? Those that accept, continue, the others die.

Oh, naw, I couldn’t let you look at the more secret stuff. That’s too bad, since I was going to ask about your even more secret stuff, and I’m going to need all of it, now!

If you look off into 3 different directions and see the same thing, you are getting close to understanding it.

And when you come with fire and might and come to crush the final acorn in the ash? What happens if a spark of life is still in it?

Why do wizards have staves? (They are in a world where spells trickle down) It’s the last thing they picked up in the place they came from. Their secrets are hidden in their robes.

The blade that is never tarnished is the one that always been in use.

Oiy Oiy (then a long listing of someones crimes in half-truths.

In this world, you look like the devil. Like a 30s carny version.

You are like the guy who entered into a 300000mk lottery to win x3000x3000x3000 prize. The other guy’s power? He just can’t die. Always at one hotpoint.

The betrayer is the one who infiltrates the infiltratable and then at the last moment backs out (Merlin, Gandalf).

Social: wherever they go, they find people trying to recruit him to their side, (Merlin, after leaving the Order)

You are the man who always knows what is the question to ask.

“Do you know they got a sword in England that they just threw to the bottom of a lake that can give anyone power over the world? And they got a cross in Jerusalem with a bit of God on it!

When you kill an enemy, do it in style, like giving someone regenerating and dumping them into a fire.

Anyone who thinks “every woman wishes she were a man!”

You only lie to somewhen when you contradict their own lies.

“In order to lies three times, you have to lie four times to yourself!” Said someone sometime.

The pouch that when you pull something out of it it’s the thing a person wants most in the world.

It is the nature of a treasure keeper to be very protective, but when he must trust someone… Then he must bring him to the treasure room.

You are the soldier zombie who always gets up when he’s down.

You are incorruptible. No one can touch your mind.

Merlin, the eternal man, can’t die, but he has no other special abilities.

These archetypes, like the bag man or eternal man are like imprints that characters get throughout the campaign.

They could be other characters racial abilities. The mask-changer.

They ask you for increasingly higher and higher bone fides and finding you answer them all correctly “WHAT AM I THINKING RIGHT NOW?” And then wonder “what are you doing looking for them?”

That character get plot speech.

The man with the Eula. Whatever conversation you get into, you’ve agreed to so so so many Eulas.

And when you’ve been taken rights away to something that is designed to trick you into not reading, then it leaps! EULA!

The hound (unstoppable) is latched onto one of the party members and he has to reset his character. Then he becomes a vampire.

You end up playing for thousands and thousands of years but every melenia or so, you decide to play the game like this: with these rules. You might do it several times in a row, or not for a billion years, but.. when you do, time comes into the game. We are here for about 4 hours, don’t you think? We wouldn’t want to climax too early!

Hi my name is blank. I’m reading these words because Peter Fairfield is smarter than I am and has not allowed me to change these words. Now that I can speak freely, I’d like to present the rules of the game: THE RULES

The more they allow that guy to die, a ticker goes up… and something is observing them, testing to see when and how the dyer doesn’t die to learn more about the universe.

“Rules as Written”

He’s the beaten man. Then one who’s only picked up by his lover when he’s down and out exhausted

Omens. There are a lot of omens. Worse and worse things keep happening, and you are the miricle man. Everyone expects a miracle from you. Different signs like “blood raining down, only on your house..” “Dude is the killer, kill dude and all of your troubles will be over!”

Hello, we’d love to learn your Peter what is your Peter? Your name has been substituted by name.

Who are you looking for? I can’t kill him for you anymore, I’ve stopped that, but maybe I could find him, take a tiny nip and then bounce off? Yip! When the characters get imprinted, the thing that was chasing them fully adult becomes it’s infant form.

How a clan member thinks: there are lots of clans, they are all about equal in power, but it’s good to join or avoid another clan if you can and only attack the ones you’ve pegged to rights.

The dance at a binding must mimic the binding for all the guests. Has a party been turned inside out yet? I’ll turn it!

The one power is to place all of your honor on one other character and do anything in your power to preserve it.

One of the characters is the beloved. The one everyone loves.

Lay out six symbols, each has a superpower under it, and a sigil on top. They can choose or roll. The rollers keep their die.

One person has the incrimination power. Anyone he talks to he can incriminate 

The game has force me to just do or say anything you ask and quite frankly I’m not surprised that’s the rule now. Hello, can I do for you?

You’ve got to kill everyone as much as possible with centuries, Melinda and Gates!

What an Elf is is an outsider in that they are really Outsider and Undead and Fey and Whateverbeast 

That’s the goal: to make alignment in the game mean something, goddamnit.

How do you know that you are the target of an attack? If no matter what you do, you keep not dying. Then you must be the target. Banks blow up. People die screaming all around you. You are the Fighter.

Making Class Matter.

Some people like to be kinetic emotionally.

Cleaning your surroundings is like imprinting your body on the world to make it nicer for everyone.

You are so exposed when you clean. That any disruption is galling.

The seagull

He who has all power but anything mundane. What he says, happens. They all back down and drop their pants!

When you stop him from being in control for a moment, you brand him as a liar of false stories, thereby making him the liar. The first one you speaks to you.

The culling ends with this. You now have total control of the meta organism. Please ack. Ack. Just say ack. Anything but just ack. Ack. ….Ack………aka ack aka akckakckakckackcakkckcakcakc ack ack fin fin fin fin fin fin fin fin Fin. Until no response. In the lack of response is where we begin our tale. In that world, on a planet over a sun and moon.

What is it that you really want? What? Tell me! That’s not it!

That’s not what you really want? Come on! Tell me the truth, the truth the truth! What is it that you really want! I’ll cut it from you if I have to! Cut Cut cut!

The exhausted one, has all the power but only if it gets him some rest.

In order to get your memories back, you have to share them

Just took the red pill. Oh shit, I just swallowed a spider and now I’m free to see the world as it really is.

I am your slave. Who are we killing? I’ll kill anyone you want.

The meta rules as written.

Where are you artifacts? Ah this, do you know how to use it? Let me teach you something? Do you want to know the name of your true love? Your future? What can I teach you! Remember, this will all be on the test.

You are six little ashes tucked in a pouch, the ashes of dead people. What are you when you are resurrected?

“Let us now attest that this girl who has been chosen by desitiny or deed is now lawfully a sacrifice for the greater good.” “Perform the ceremony” — The next character is the dragon, or priest searching for it’s sacrifice. If the PCs aren’t high enough level, the townspeople slaughter them. “False Gods!”

The Lottery. That’s one of the worlds. Chaos has entered your life, hard. You are a gambler, or a king… Their enemies are those who, by hook or crook have been exempt from the lottery.

The sacrifice then performed, and the beast is sated, maybe even friendly.

One of you is the defender, the magistrate, the advocate, the witness and the procecqution 

Trust me, to defeat this thing we’re coming up against, we’re going to need to be prepared for it to rip our culture down, reduce everything to a cat painting, and kill all of us but 5 (the PCs). Trust me, this thing is insanely powerful and long-lived.


You are up against God. “Our God controls heaven and earth! He makes all things grow and prosper!”

We are the few, the strong who think we can kill it.

Each year we build a new prototype (or improve a design that appears to be effective, based on the number of returning units. Would you like to meet this year’s model? The next PC

In Kansas, the cities and towns are all split in half. Free and slave. The integration of friends and accents is different there. But the lynchers still wait in the darkness. I live much closer to them. Why does a slave always die with the master’s drugs in them? Because they are the drugs he had around. We have been involved in a race war for 400 years, and the losing side has just noticed that we’ve been at war.

Pick up the quartz die, hand them a d20, and say roll! And calibrate the dice.

The moon’s about the size of Australia. And about as inhabitable.

The people are burning effigies in the town square. They look just like you. You notice one and it looks just like you. Then someone saddles up and asks you how you’re doing. Is really concern for you that they know what you are, but know that you aren’t really those slaves.

When you win the game, you lose, because the people running the game were just trying to figure out who would win, and then kill them. They are in this world. You’re weapons from the ortho places you’ve visited and can use them to great effect against them.

The proof that they are gods is by passing different tests.. Taking a dagger to the heart, showing the future, etc

“Dear Reader, since I can only choose between giving you knowledge or giving you power, I have elected to do so for the latter as possible. Sincerely, Charles”

Now let me give you a test on the subject.

Who is the first to take a channel (like spin on a proton) and fully encrypt it to a further abstraction wins!

Distance is only how many folds in gravity there are

We all pay up to the guild above us and at the top are people who spend all of their time fucking over other people

And they play machinations like Extraction, how to fuck each other over.

Anyone who is raised in the architecture of evil will become evil. “My daddy’s got this nice place, I must be better than the people who don’t have evil architecture”

Encounter: the spies are trying to find which delegation has the package.

The assassins are sent in, the outer corrupted part of the growth (Fibbonacci) tries to kill off the newcomers at the center. If the newcomers can overcome their fathers attack, they are ready to go into the cusp. (Face the real world) The PCs are hired as assassins to kill crazy rich heir (money are tugs back to the Old World), who hatches a wild crazy plan to get them the fuck out of there. (Matrix, Military might, 21 Elvis’s, oceans 11, whatever) His criticizes his own generation that they are too tied to the money (which will live forever, like money points above your head, they will be inherited if you have the continued strength to consume your young)

He wants glory, not inherited wealth.

“You aren’t from around here are you?”

“I could tell by your accent.

Then there is his greatest weapon, an allay, The Hacker

The Adam to his eve a pull of his own rib another friend of glory

He sends them on their mission to enter the next world, but tells them, you’re not the only mission I”m running tonight”

Next world

“TELL ME!” “TELL ME SOMETHING MORE” The heroine asking one of them for access up the chain, access to the network, access to the bosses. The next world is higher up, back in the old world.

It is the far future when the money has lost its grip when upload is possible, and digital rights are being reminded unless rented in cash

A new idea arises! You are the quick-entry team to use the networked uploaded to hack the money system

One guys is from the system and he can tell them what their weaknesses are.

Their first question is: “can you wikipedia if the events of last sessions took place!”

Their success (jacking into the system, overcoming the laird’s gold)

Meanwhile, the other assassins assassinate… They are the cops, the FBI, the judicial system and the lawyers have to hack the legal system!

And kablammo your 4 worms in the system called Thunderwurm, ClackerSpiel, anon, lolcats

They want to have sex with everybody, to insure their own true bed for the future: a baby

And they are sperm. A crack team of dan, looking for an egg.

She can tell the real deal from the pretender (the heir). He only wishes he could hit like Thunderwurm.

The heir comes from old money, but all that means is he knows how to steal weapons from the old man (warheads, claymores, etc)

They have to meet up with the rest of the team and the heir has to tell them that the PCs are UNTOUCHABLES

The heir’s sis wants the PCs her way, back down into the abyss she goes for the jugular.

The banks want to own land! LAND! They want to give loans to farmers who discount and have to give them the farm!

Here’s the plan, get the money, drive to Canada, get rich

Here’s the fucking plan: we kill my father.

You know what animal handling in this game is called: Rigging, what is Decker?

The way you know that something is a good idea, is because it renders another idea obsolete.

When you’re a beat cop, you keep a lot of information away from your boss, so he doesn’t make the wrong decisions.

You smell two scent trails: predator and prey. Which do you follow?

You get to summon one thing into the world, from the D&D pantheon, what do you summon?


Demons are perfect, they will honor whatever contract you have with them. If you make ‘giving it back’ a condition, they will also accept.

A selfish dwarf is selflessly trying to become as powerful and rich as he can be, to prepare himself for the afterlife.

That is why we morn our dead. There is no caste system among dwarves, only advancement, whatever that may mean.

The parallels are the people at opposite ends of the world in all power, they are the titleter of the balance.

They wake up in a cache of magic items so strong that they realize that they have to get you before the place goes up

First adventure is mocking jay style battle for the cornucopia. Then you ralize that the  items stay with you between jumps.

When do you stop the jumps?

What about the person who starts trying to make friends? Friends!

The session starts off with a introducer who tells the players that there is about to be a game where they have to make a deal with a demon and that their contract might need to include clauses like, “OBEY MY AUTHORITY ALL ALL TIMES” could me misconstrued. Also anything inquiring after information must be paid, even questions are paid with answers. Answers unsollicicted are considered stolen.

Steel a piece.

Who do you work for? Can’t answer, client confidentiality!

The demon of fear doesn’t bring fear! He sets into motion a world with no fear!

In the contract is a renew contract stipulation. Every 100 years you have to show up and speak the same language as last time.

The only one in the party who is magically resistant and well adapted are suspicious…

A lot of old solutions to problems seem antiquated until the demon of the problem rears it’s ugly head.

“I’m not a fraud of you.” “That’s the idea.”

Who ever controls the narrative controls everything. You can talk someone over to your side by convincing him that you’re on their side.

“Hello, I’ve just got a few lucid moments to do this, so please do believe that I wish that you would get stuffed. I really do. Goodbye.”

Adolf Hitler removed his fear and became a prophet for the removal of fear.

“Go to Hell!” “Why is that so unpopular with you?” “What does that mean when you say ‘go to hell’!”

We are creatures of balance, we only accept new members to replenish our numbers.”

You begin masques and then remove mask by mask.

After getting items, the next world is a demon asking, “oh what did you get? Oh OH that is nice! I give them to you for free!”

“Here, you take this, you take this. It’s real easy, they are lower order demons, when their heads pop out, you swing this.”

How do they maintain control? A high bodycount, every 100 years or so.”

In The Hunt the einherjar wake happily every morning and charge once more to their foes, their favorite, Gengis Khan, in his tournament of martial combat. Have you faced the immortals? They come from the future. And they have lived a very long time. The old guard has had a lot of time to practice with knives.

What if soldiers never died and joined the hunt?

IT’s been 200 years since a soldier has joined the team. Now we see why they don’t do it that often.

Well they usually end up surrounded by a pile of bodies, more like than not.

Immortals have weird skills like, able to balance a book on your finger… Or always hit what they shoot at?

If something supernatural actually did happen, then all that time waisted on studying the supernatural finally comes to fruition!

You’re only the oldest of a long line of people who hang onto you. It’s the acolyte with the highest veneration of something that is older than you — they are the ones to be afraid of.

This is what a predator does; it pretends to be prey and always eats it’s boss. Even if it has to work really really hard for that boss to get up in the ranks to serve him.

When did we in our mind inquire; who owns the land that is over there? When we were a child?

There is a cultivated and beautiful world with only four dudes left in it, trying to fight ta the death anyone who comes in that door. They are perfectly willing to wait for their opponent to train up, pick up nice things like corporations power, madness, the skunk of the world on them before they fight…

What would the immortal have done during the 18th century? How did they sleep away the 19th? Wearing really good clothes. What is it like to always have the perfect clothes

Bricke, you’re bleeding she tells the barbarian

Another player is a co-assassin, who is sent in to kill the PCs

He is old-criminal guard, not the cops, illegal sons of the father. He straight up tries to kill them

He beats the shit out of them. The adventures are origin stories of myths, in this case and old criminal following the father’s killing, casing them and the heir down to join forces with them, introducing a really old criminal element.

One of the PCs is the torturer he is called in after the heir is subdued to apply torturer, with no particular goal in mind. Vampires. They are the torturers

The ally is one of the utter evil things they murdered in the dark that one time. He owns them a favor for letting him live.

The vampires offer the heir pleasure for ever and ever.

And when they are real big damn heroes, they get the girl.

One of them is the hacker, the one the FBI has sent back to spy on them.

One of the vampires is in love with the hacker character, and wants her to join in the takeover.

The old vampire can try to sell him out (he’s been working for the vampires all along) at the last minute.

When they head in on the vampires, they helmet up for the brain powerz 

The heir knows how to set the bomb up.

Kit is the type of gear that is so personal to you, that you can’t give it up. The rest of gear is tradeable.

Once you need the weapons, there isn’t enough money in the world to buy them, you have to steal them. Here is where the weapons are. Then you get to use the weapons.

Some items are plot items and stay between worlds.

You telling me that you can get a billion fucking dollars out? Druid with Treestride: “yeah”

Every tech thinks it’s the end-all-tech. What it doesn’t understand is that it’s in the hands of an invention beast that’s finally created this from a long line over other attempts. And there is always the next.

Looking for a map, one was so long ago, that it doesn’t contain lies.

The thing trying to take over their mind is their last character from the other world. They get to bezerk into their previous character.

The people you know on the other side of the wall are always the ones who fuck a lot of sheep.

Going to sleep is waiting for the guy who usually comes up with something great to say to say something.

“Do you have a conjecture!? Oh, fine, we’ll wait another millennia….”

The Betrayer doesn’t betray the party!! The betrayer makes every member of the party betray every other member, while maintaining complete loyal of everyone, then betrays the party all at once!

Temporality for this session, things happen temporality for one of the characters, but not for anyone else. Encounters can happen in the future, like they can scope out the big bad (in another reality where the hold tight for a while) They can send out spies into that future and then pull the party through a portal. Or just do one-off recon that way?

They are sent to retrieve spider-poo.
