# Disaster 
 Go do the deck right now and assign cards.
 First one: disaster.

The Tower: The University. Done.
The Fool: Bols. Everything that can goes wrong.
The Magician: The DM, obvs.
The High Priestess: Shawn Fallstaff, I mean, why look for a needle in a haystack, when the stack can come to you, offering you Mes of the most influential variety. Here is the problem, older and less eeeevil friends of hers are looking out for them and prevent a full collision. In this case, the Aunts:
Queen of Pentackles:  The old witch. The carer for her young, willing to sacrifice all for her little ones. She will try to prevent a full-on infection, but will care deeply for the intellect devourers unleashed upon the city.
Queen of Cups: Edo Rian 
Temperence: Aqua Fresca. Aunt Agnus, pure and loyal in her commitments. Fresh as a flowing stream. Truth, in all things, truth. "There may be another compromise to be reached." We wish to halt this facet of Fallstaff's work. I have an idea for how this might work for both of us (after 1 or 2 good slubbing encounters... a chance to talk?)

(I store my ideas in tarot cards so they can be fished out in the morning.)

The Empress: Aunt Elisa Aprodite, the 12 stars on her crown
The Heirophant: Char. The Dungeon Creator, Ich. The builder of the bridge between you and the divine.
Strength: Roma the Lion.
The Hermit: Fred.
The Wheel: The Fates
Justice: Malak Babbi Fran
VIII of Wands: Rebecca Horne, Horn O'Roads.
III of Wands: Captain Buckfest
