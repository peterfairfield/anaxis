# Harrow

0: The Fool: Bols, Niflar. Everything that can goes wrong.

I: The Magician: The DM, obvs. I recommend roleplaying all of these characters.

II: The High Priestess: In this case, but this like the DM is chose from from whomever the players end up trusting the most -- Shawn Fallstaff, I mean, why look for a needle in a haystack, when the stack can come to you, offering you Mes of the most influential variety. Here is the problem, older and less eeeevil friends of hers are looking out for them and prevent a full collision. In this case, the Aunts.

III: The Empress: Aunt Elisa Aprodite, the 12 stars on her crown

IV: The Emperor: The Black Emperor

V: The Heirophant: [Char](/p/char.md). The Dungeon Creator, Ich selbe. The builder of the bridge between you and the divine.

VI: The Lovers: [Ava and Fred](/p/t/the_lovers.md)

VII: The Chariot: Cracked and broken, still griding along. Sounds like [Nilfar](/p/niflar.md)

VIII: Strength: [Roma](/p/roma.md) the Lion. Silar, Jet

XII: The Hanged Man: [Parson Fillstorm](/p/parson.md)

XIII: Death: [Askha'hle](/p/askhahale.md)

XIV: Temperence: Aqua Fresca. [Aunt Agnus](/p/aunt_agnus.md), pure and loyal in her commitments. Fresh as a flowing stream. Truth, in all things, truth. "There may be another compromise to be reached." We wish to halt this facet of Fallstaff's work. I have an idea for how this might work for both of us (after 1 or 2 good slubbing encounters... a chance to talk?)

XV: The Devil: The Black Emporer, General Narses, Undeth, Siobane TBD (Bashmu, the dragon)

XVI: The Tower: [The University](/f/the_university.md). And once it get's started, the [moveable library](/t/the_moveable_library.md)

King of Coins: Ambition, Wisdom, Power: King Pyre  
Queen of Coins:  [Skyre Gowan](/p/skyre_gowan.md). The old witch. The carer for her young, willing to sacrifice all for her little ones. She will try to prevent a full-on infection, but will care deeply for the intellect devourers unleashed upon the city.
