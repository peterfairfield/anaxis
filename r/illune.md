# Harrow

0: The Fool: Bols, Niflar. Everything that can goes wrong.  
I: The Magician: The DM, obvs. I recommend roleplaying all of these characters.  
II: The High Priestess: In this case, but this like the DM is chose from from whomever the players end up trusting the most -- Shawn Fallstaff, I mean, why look for a needle in a haystack, when the stack can come to you, offering you Mes of the most influential variety. Here is the problem, older and less eeeevil friends of hers are looking out for them and prevent a full collision. In this case, the Aunts.

XIV: Temperence: Aqua Fresca. [Aunt Agnus](/p/aunt_agnus.md), pure and loyal in her commitments. Fresh as a flowing stream. Truth, in all things, truth. "There may be another compromise to be reached." We wish to halt this facet of Fallstaff's work. I have an idea for how this might work for both of us (after 1 or 2 good slubbing encounters... a chance to talk?)
