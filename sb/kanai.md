>

>
> ***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.
>
>
> ***Heat Metal (1/day, 2nd level spell, concentration).*** 60 ft range. 1 target  metal weapon. The wielder takes 2d8 fire damage and must pass a DC 13 CON save or drop the weapon. Can repeat this as a bonus action every turn against the same target as long as the spell lasts.
>
> ***Faerie Fire (1/day, 1st level spell, concentration).*** 60 ft range, 20 ft cube, DC 13 DEX save. On a failed save, all attacks have advantage against the target and they can't benefit from invisibility.
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Bear Form (2/day).*** The druid gains 34 temp HP. As long as it has this temp HP, it is a bear, it can't cast spells, and its AC is 11.

>***Summoning Spells.*** Summmoning spells are often the strongest offensive spells that a given class has access to, particularly for Bards, Druids, and Rangers. I haven't put them on any of these stat blocks because they slow combat down, they don't usually make for super memorable moments, and they require referencing other rules that you may not have handy. Feel free to swap them in if you feel up to it, though.
