> ### Reactions
> ***Shield (4/day).*** As a reaction to being targetted with an attack, the Artificer may add 5 to its AC until the beginning of its next turn.

> ***Spells as Abilities.*** I don't think a stat block should ever require you to reference another book/document, so I've chosen to turn all spells into spell-like abilities, at least in presentation. I've included spell levels for all spells of 1st level or higher for the purposes of counterspelling.
>
>A spellcaster will typically not need every one of their spell slots for a 3-6 round combat, so many have fewer here. They also won't need a bunch of RP spells prepared for a combat encounter, which is what stat blocks are for after all. Minute resource tracking is for players. The DM has too much going on to have to worry about that.
