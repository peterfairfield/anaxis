What is the difference between texts and other internet usage?

Do my children feel the same way about text as I do about email? Certainly not.

They always know the bazar from the front porch. So terrible that those channels are always compromised. Do I think that email will eventually be different? HOw stragely do I have to disguise my messages such that future generations won't fuck up the meaning?

They begin with tight knots, but they can be mined like coin is printed. This is like your phone number. You agree to be on a public, fairly regulated non-random registry. Then how do you treat the other person on the phone?
