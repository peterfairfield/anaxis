While parenting the things we seek in our heads, the stategy of the game that we set for our children, comes out in our play: "clean plate club", "ice-cream club" each have their different set of stages and and incentive patterns.

What is the difference between texts and other internet usage?

Do my children feel the same way about text as I do about email? Certainly not.

They always know the bazar from the front porch. So terrible that those channels are always compromised. Do I think that email will eventually be different? HOw stragely do I have to disguise my messages such that future generations won't fuck up the meaning?

They begin with tight knots, but they can be mined like coin is printed. This is like your phone number. You agree to be on a public, fairly regulated non-random registry. Then how do you treat the other person on the phone?

When they dropped the Machiavelli: from the beginning of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. But in this case we aren't talking about the Role Napolean III was to play in this, if only he were more clearly the character. They straight up fall for the tyrant, through Joly, Machiavelli, they fell for the devil.

GREAT IDEA
Build a board, build figurines and characters and actually keep the board somewhere safe.

Seeing Volume at a point or collapsing a curve into a volume is how it feels to shift a dimension up or down. You are literally adding up and swallowing a dimension C.

1. What is paeleodicteon is just the left-over tools of a crashed spaceship. It stuctures poop into food, it builds a tube net grid of glass, it filters somethings, and then it poops out berelyim crystls.

2. What if cooperation and intelligence were built into the grid? What if this is the story of the brain getting stronger? Or of this massive intelligence network of old gods, once built in the cooperation of the deep sea, now controlling the minds of millions, created from hexagonal structures. The elevation of one man or the destruction of another, this is the pumps of the paeleodicteons at work.

Silence.

"I am white supremecist?" Then the thunder rolled, and the fiddles scraped.

Here are some ideas:

1. We've had a few encounters with 5e demons/devils in the campaign, but given what we've just learned about the origins of the Hunger, I'd have to admit I that haven't been pay close attention as to who they were. We haven't had encounters with them since we've been to Kingsbridge, and got a lot of books on the knackers and some inkling of what their world was like, we've not seen any evidence of Esh'la any whereabouts (unless Despair has abandoned them), but we haven't had a real non-temple-combat encounter with them. Akbeth and Aldeath have been borderline in there... Not sure.  Since the first one back by the stone table when we were level, we have had some conversations, but I do recall that Temper was largely belligerent at time, and didn't really want to talk to them. Since reading the history of Arva, Temper does now wonder, what were the horrors for the next world, what would cause havok like the Unnamed Horror and the Leviathan? The besieged people's resilience and nerve (and the bath) gave Temper a shot to the arm, but their great obsession with the immediate future was probably an exhausting thing for Temper. Since the dwarves only have the past tense, and that only barely --yash, he was astounded at their use of the future tense, which rung around his head and boggled him only slightly less than the open sky. On our reaction to the sky: the world of dwarves is Okma (well ordered). Yash Okma refers to “the other/that ordering”, or to previous orderings. There is no word for infinity, the closet they come is 'without visual horizon'. 


2. I do recall an ouroboros cult in the exodus campaign. There were the Fainin snake people we met coming over the swampy forest. They certainly hinted at something that at the time I didn't remark as Hunger-related, but since have reconsidered.

3. Ahashyn. Another thing we learned in Kingsbridge: the soul magic the thinmen were using had broken down in the city, so they weren't able to hold the wards closed, but we didn't stick around long enough to power one up, or see how that whole apparatus worked. There are a lot of ahashtics in gresnek, so along with the demons, we have to wonder who they are. 

In conclusion, I think a good source for JC onboarding would be Esh'la, given our current redemption quest (have a demon wear the robe in the hall of
