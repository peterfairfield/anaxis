## Crossing with [Falstaff](/p/fallstaff.md)

Fallstaff: The Natural College wiil have noticed something, I'm not sure what may have gotten through undetected. In any case, we need to begin to be careful in our movements to not furthur alert them to our actions.
...
Fallstaff: Do you have any go-down?
Fallstaff, upon learning that Hiram has the place on lockdown: You think she's overreacting, think how the University is going to respond. How far into the Island can we get these jars?

## Hauling the Jars Around

This could be a chore. There are as many as the party plus one, so someone will have to double up, or contrive a sledge or cart to carry them. Maybe someone can magic up a cart? How will that look?

Elsela: I've been made to take the blame for so many of her mistakes, this time there will be no concession. What negociations has she made with the University?
Fall

## Scenes

## Triggering the Jars

Once the crones have been neutralized, they will place the jars on top of them, and settle jars on her heads. Elsela says: take it all out. He does, and the Leaf Game is put on haitus. The City Changes, a pease decends on it in the streets, in the houses and meeting halls, everyone is just trying to figure out what is going on. People outside the Leaf Game will quickly take a hand in some things: The Silvermen will get their Borderlords, and the College of the Mind will find a an influx of support from the Danoi factions.

## Borderlords

This also sets off a chain of events climaxing in the crowning of the [Silver King](/p/silar.md), the death of the Black Empororer and the coming of the end. 

As soon as word reaches Lagash that the Borderlords have been given title, there will some sudden lunges for the throat amoung the Primals. In the end, there are only 9 left alive.

### When Elsela and Hiram meet each other

Hiram: Edo. (bows)
Elsela: Edo. (coughs and bows) There is no need to maintain this facade in front of our friends.
Hiram: Cough.
Elsela: They've been to the tower and had breakfast. They actually scared some rats out and made the beds.
Hiram: Proper.
Elsela: Do you know about #etc...

### When they debrief with Bore: 

With great trepidation, Bore: "Who did you say she was, in our world?"

He sits down. Motions to sit down. "You may want to sit. You see, all this *motions to the pattern* has been a project for a position at Bolsingers, where I am applying for fellowship."

"Yup"

"Professor Elsela is my advisor, the Pattern is my doctorate."

"What have I dragged you into?" -- "What have I dragged the city into?" -- "Why didn't anyone think of this... Is no-one paying attention? Do you know anyone at the Library?"
