# The Silver King Timeline

## Ram’s Shelf 

[Edo Rian](/p/rian.md) – closeted Skum and master of mind control and transference. He can get them deepdraft. “For the right price” “What will you give me for it?”

[Elara Whistle](/p/whistle.md) – emergency control during the storm. He has caught several of the beasts and put their pelts out for sale.

Roma is there, and can purr them into talking to some of the townsfolk who saw what actually happened. 

This appears to be:
There are some people who might be willing to talk.
Niama can tell them: “The Shrine of the Moon” and “The Bishop's Hide”
There is a really hot-headed Prince on the premises.
And he might start murdering people.
Edo Rian has been destroying evidence. Burning a lot of paper.

Eventually, Rian will have to go with the desires of his heart: the transference to werewolf without danger to his life, and loyalty to his mistress in the upcoming battle with Aunt Agnus, who is coming with her sahagin army to put the Kraken down, before it destroys the world.

## The Shrine of the Moon

They meet these groups in a wild concert of violence, they might be dancing? Posturing?

Jet and his gang of Silverbloods. These are lone wolves who have long been tired of the councils and the succession. Jat will deconvene the shrine if he is put into power.

There aren’t a lot of Silverblood family here, but they are quite quick, like weasels.
The Moska who are coming to pay their respects to their great friend, the spirit of the thing that is going to kill them all.

The Broken Ones – A band of Hill people with carnival like deformities, but they become something beautiful when they shift. Half are Moska. Roma is their leader.

The New in Towns – Fresh Meat – New Demons – these are recently lead by Fred, many of them work at the Natural College.

### [The Spirit Itself](/p/raphael.md)

The Prince’s Wolves – This guy is too cool to not be a main Character. Oh, this is Vamarm Silar Gloryshield, and he just crowned himself king. Silar will say “Well shoot, I’ve dabbled in fictions no more complicated than this”

### [Aunt Agnus Enters](/p/aunt_agnus.md)

When they meet her, she is unfortunately storming the shrine with a spider army of craboids. She is in a bad MLM and she needs a way out. She might be the only one in this scenario who can make the connection between the Kraken and the College. Agnus will move to take out what she sees as an element too close: Edo Nain. She blames him for brokering this alliance. Her primary goal is the dissolution of relationships between the Silverbloods and the University. Edo feels the same way, and they are on the lookout for each other.

The Spirit holy cow this needs to be something from Aunt Agnus’s past. What is she (Aboleth)? How did she grow up? Was it rough? She is an old brain-eater. She knows her bread and butter. Aunt Elisa eats the past. The Kraken eats stories.

### [Edo Nain](/p/nain.md)

He will draw them back into the past, when a Danoi army stood waiting to fight for the Blood Throne. They had marched from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and they brought with them 13,000 hoplites. The mountain passes had been well repaired and there had been no-one to accost them as they crossed to the City. They faced the armies of the Hill People, he saw their determination, their might, their paths, there they fought the Hill People. And they won.

## The Garden Path

You meet Jat and Roma, arguing but ultimately agreeing to share power when the others submit. Roma doesn’t believe this lie for a second, but she is watching for this to play out.

They are met with in force by Fred and the New Pups. Things are going to get a little tense. When the party shows up, Jat make take the opportunity to accuse Roma of stabbing him in the back and attack. Or he might be talked down, if he thinks there is still time to get further public. If the Game is back on, the Primals will now hit, otherwise, it’s just Agnus’s crew, with everything she can muster off The Shudder Cudder, a newly made ancient sea folk sloop.

The reward for brokering peace and getting the succession worked out is 1 week of foreknowledge.  +1 CHA The chaos is deep and tasty.

They hoist sail, and go howling on longships after the sloop, and they are attacked by pirates.
