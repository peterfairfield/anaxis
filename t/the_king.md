Encounters:
 * The rats -- if they succeed in getting on friendly terms, they will learn that the gang is incoming in 20 minutes.
 * The Inkeeper -- [Skyre Gowan Roan](/p/skyre_gowan.md) is sure the bandits will kill her and take her partner. They will, but are willing to bleed him for victals. Mostly, they take what they can get their hands on when they show up, and he has a fat wagon coming in this afternoon. If they aren't dealt with quick, they are going to have to hind the stuff or fight.
  * The stuff is some machine?
  * [Hap Burdain](/p/hap_burdain.md) the charmingest newsie shakedown artist.

## The Rats

The youngest huckster sweet talks his way into the camp. He has lines, and he uses them. Magnus Freeman will play the long game and try to gain their trust by bretraying his gang. He will let them know when the gang will show up and what their weaknesses are. And he wants this to work, so he doesn't open up at first.

## The Ambush

Thugs will thug. They can be very upsetting, but this is a trial force. Some of them seem real interested in the beefier players, which they consider a greater threat. What's their position on this shakedown and can they roll or do they need to jet? They may even try to hire them on as muscle. How much for the big one? Anyway, there are a lot of them and they run if there is trouble. They will come back with more, and with 

The Bandits have recently become [Broken Ones](/f/the_broken_ones.md), a sect of Erimesh who believe in the Danoi stories of the Sun King. The Sister of the Hidden Moon hold their populist tendacies in check enough in the city, but many groups, including the Order of St. Andreas have declared them heretical.

## The Aftermath

[Skyre Gowan](/p/skyre_gowan.md) will happily purchase whatever weapons or gear that they wish to sell off the bandit's bodies. If things go well, they might even throw a party.

## Bore shows up 

Optio Bols has been sent to help secure the area. 

## The Exiled Exarch

Alan Bore raises the hue and cry on Hap and will try get him killed. If he can't convince them that this is a good idea,
he will give up on the idea and just keep a close eye on him, and maybe try to get him killed.

He will use the corpse of the traveller that he's kept in his wagon as evidence to accuse Freeman. Freeman
is a wolf ("he doesn't even shave!"), but not the one who killed Joey. Bore will then speak with dead and ask some questions. The unfortunate Joey was set upon by dogs, little ones and big ones.  -- he will allow them to add questions to his list which are:

q. How did you die?
a. Those dogs! Little dogs and big dogs! Little one got me by the foot, then the big one choked my windpipe.
q. Was anyone there besides the dogs?
a. There was someone calling earlier. Jub Jub.
q. What did you want?
a. I was trying to get a tree to bend down.

If Bore does ever catch Magnus he will throw the book at him, "for Joey".

## The Giver's Garden

Home of [Parson](/p/parson.md). He wants you to take care of the real problem here: the Black outbreak in the Firest. From his perspective, it's a matter of knowing which direction to run in, to head to the center of things or get the authorities to shut the Forest Down. He was heading in the direction, and now he has Bore at his fingertips. He will want to march him immediately into the Cork Gate, and call for a quarenteen of the Forest and the Chippies, if he can.
