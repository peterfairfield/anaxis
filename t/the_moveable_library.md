# The Moveable Library

## The Committee

This is enjoined at any event where they might be present: Lord Saxon could bring it up at the [Lady Horne's Party], or he could summon them. He will introduce them to the Host and present them with a team: Buckfest, Silar (currently presumed Executor), The Black Emporer, and Ava Gavin. Their roles are:

Buckfest: Getting them to and fro on the water.

Silar: What the movements and disposition of the Host might be.

Black Emporer: King Solen loves tearing down walls.

Ava Gavin: In charge of the move. Getting the people to move the books.

Lesure: In charge of the construction of the building. The Naval College is also at your disposal directly through him.

Yours: The Host forces in charge of this operation.

First mission: find out who is stealing the books.

## Have a nice Party

Ava will approach them and try to schedule a meeting with them.

How the process goes:

1. Catalogue all works as they go out. 
2. Each library will move in serial. This is a lie, Ava plans on moving whatever whereever at any time.
3. Donations will flow in throughout. Several private collections, in particular of Naval Officers have already been moved, prior to finished construction.
4. Archives will get presorted in several cases: [Bard's Library](/l/bards_libary.md) archives, as well as several other large collections that resulted from previous overflow, in particular the Golem School archives.
5.
