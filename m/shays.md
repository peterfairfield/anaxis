## Shayâ€™s Shop

This is a mechanics shop for building almost anything out of iron. Silver and bronze are worked here as well, building nails and arrowheads. There are some weapons for sale, but they would be mostly second hand, anything else is made for orders. Shopping there might be:

> The Lady Ava, searching for clue to some lost family possessions, they can help her find the Dagger, the Bowl, and the Staff/Egg.

> Sargent Horne, or perhaps [Sickman](/p/sickman), inspecting weapons

> Magnus

 Here's a footnote [^1].
