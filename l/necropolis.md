Necropolis: 

The temples of the old city, kept from urbanization with their own beauty. They have become the city of the dead. Ashes and bones in bundles.

Some Ratlings have taken up residence, and Harper will hire them to clear them out. The vampire lords are also not happy about people poking around, in particular, Tribune Chamander has connections with the Wizards, and would like to mess with them, a lot.

A cabal of revisionists.
