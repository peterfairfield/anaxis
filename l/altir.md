# Altir

A city drowned in administration. At least everyone complains about it enough. The results are impressive. Completely insane chaos of buildings in a network of very nicely connectings avenues. There are several enclaves or burroughs now consumed by the city's advance:

> ***Narssi***
> Heavy Mounted Infantry, dissolves into flanking archery. 

There are indications that the mind flayers have been looking to stay unknown, but Shawn thinks it is time to rip off the bandaid. When there is no way out, Aunt Agnes calls for him. She remembers him as a sweet child. He began with such innocence, a blithe and open mind. Now it is one that is distracted. This is a thing Shawn does:

He straps mindjars on their heads and gives them these powers:
Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.

Extract Brain. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. Hit: The target takes 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This psychic blast can be absolutely devastating to a party in combat. It's important to note that a stunned victim automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws.

Magic Resistance

You Smell thoughts, your head full of smoke. You see the comet hit Kers Island. If they have seen evidence of the leaf game's movements, and to end the war with Trigan returning in triumph with Undeath in tow. They do communicate with the leaf game in the strangest way you can imagine. I'd write notes and scatter them around, hoping nobody picks them up and reads them. know what is coming and that you must warn Bore. 

If anyone wants to continue to use their flayer, they can take favored class mind flayer and get that stat block (TBD)

Once they are on the island, he will open the jars and climb inside. The jars can open up like:

"Ok, now he want's me to talk to you. Hi! "

One will be silent, just following your will. This will take some effort to get it to speak, a shyness that it struggles with. Then there might be sudden bouts of control. 

"I am the voice that can only become more bothersome to you the more you listen to it." Wilfred will remain silent until events forge a bond. There are many secrets she knows. She can pierce veils and discover the truth.
