# The Holomine Towers

## Construction

Approx. 14th century by the people of Ram's Shelf. They are coralcrete towers, about 300 ft high, scattered and clumped througout the city. A ridge of them forms the north half of the Kirkhalls.

## Lottery

The Holomine Lots are drawn up monthly. The great price is often money, or a plate of gold and silver. The motto is something dreadful, like rhyming in latin.
