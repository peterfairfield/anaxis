# The Silver Mountain

## Fortress
Held by the Empire.

## The Mine

Nearly destroyed in the fighting, the Empire hasn't yet been able to get it running, but they are quickly making progress clearing it out.

## On the Road

### Goblin Ambush

A pile of Boglins use the terrain to ambush them on the river, perhaps during a portage?

### Boglin hideout:

### Lodetown

A settlement spanning the falls, it was burned by King Pyre. There are several quests in Lodetown to wit:
 * Word on the Street: a man Gund Halfshield was killed by the White Shirts and his wife and daughter have disappeared.
 * Hospitallers: Dara Hissop. Deal with the White Shirts. They are shaking everyone down and have started killing people. She has heard about prospectors heading to the Dog Wells.
 * Orchard: Gertie Horning. Her family makes sheep & apples and gathers fly eggs. They have been raided by the goblins and can put the players back on their trail. 
    + A kid there, Trellis, can show them a back entrance to the Whiteshirts if they can befriend him.
    + They are missing their vet, a druid named Silkcloth. He was making a trip back to his home near Little Mountain.
 * Miners: Orc raids, the mine's finer points of access, etc. They are losing people to the White Shirts. Some of them just want to take over and replace them. She is an agent of the Theatre, and depending on their relations with them, she will either oppose them and join the White Shirts eventually or replace their leader.
 * Town Master: Shel Winter -- no relation. She is complicit with the Whiteshirts and points out that they have kept the town safe from the raiding Orcs and Boglins. If they have Silar or Esme or whomever they rescued along with them, they will probably throw Shel into prison and assume control of Lodetown.
 * Trading Post: Bart Terman -- friend of Esmetal He knows where the White Shirts spend their time. He also knows about the current state of the mine, and who has been trying sabotage the Empire's efforts.
    + Bart will let Silar know about Iorek Athema -- a Danoi professor of The Pact -- has been missing for a few months.
        > Silar will mutter "we'd better get some [Saltboxes](#saltboxes "dispel magic scrolls")"
    + If Silar finds out what Iorek has been doing (using the Whiteshirts for personal pleasure and gain) he will want him brought back alive to Eschar.
 * Shrine: Edo Gale Salman, a Watcher of the Waters, wants to know about the Mes Absur, and he has tracked Aunt Agatha to the base of the falls. If they have contacts with the Aunts, they would be able to talk to Agatha on his behalf.

 > Event:
 > If they don't immediately move on the Whiteshirts, they will encounter them in town, swilling down ill-gotten ale and accosting people on the street. They will smell fresh blood and take a bite at the newcomers. They will attack with 2-1 odds. They will spread the curse as far as possible. This deeply horrifies everyone and esp. Esmetal. Esmetal will hunt down the progeny and tell them about the groups in Eshar for their first transformation. He gives them his seal.

 > Once this has occurred, an assault on the keep is imminent. 

 ### Tollstone Keep
 The Whiteshirts have moved into the basements. This will be a tough nut to crack.

Yes, Iorek has contracted the curse of the Silvermen and has now build a blood-cadre of Whiteshirts. He has been collecting people from the countryside to infect and study their bloodlines. He had determined that he needs blood of the older clans, but hasn't quite caught the bloodline of the serpent that keeps the disease from being rapidly fatal. He was unable to get the whole Halfshield family, but he's rapidly gone to work infecting Joanna and Elena with enough Sa to choke a goat and watching how it progresses and kills them. So far, there haven't been any results, but Joanna is starting to lose her shit. Joanna and Elena are of the most ancient family of High Dara, and her brother is in fact
