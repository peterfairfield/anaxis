  

The Broken Leg

The Theatre runs the show here, at one of the nicest eateries in town. The first time they arrive here should be before the bookburning. There is a dust-up between Navvies and two Officers, Executor Bore and Nate Hound.Â 

  

The Officers are caught without their insignia, and the Navvies pretend not to know them. Executor Bore thinks a fight is a good idea, for at this moment he wants to catch two merchants at the Broken Leg who have information he is interested in. He will goad the Navvies into a fight, but in a way that will make them look like the aggressors. He will send Mr. Allbert to keep things running smoothly. Magnus and Sarl will be the scribes who kick a bit of butt.

  

The players can join any side of the fight they wish, or just leave. The two Officers are worried about some of the behavior in the Host they are noticing, perhaps having to do with the Trial of the Rat Hunt. The Navvies and Bore & Nate Hound refuse to pull weapons on each other. The Officers will defend their friend (involved in the Rat Hunt), but do want to know what is happening with the cover-up. Mr. Allbert might want to arrest them, if he overhears too much. Fat Mat will whack some heads.

  

Hound will tell the party that Sir Hatchaxel has been getting into a lot of debt. He is a little too close to the Smallacres, the owners of the Abbey of St. Claire on Kess Island.

  

The chef is Fat Mat, who describes another person who often met with Mushussu and Sarl. The party may remember them from the last time they were at the Broken Leg, and things got a little rough.

  

Fat Mat is Moska

There is another job he has for them:

1.  He can set them up to be framed for murder. Then the Tearers chase them all over creation, and they have to clear their name.
