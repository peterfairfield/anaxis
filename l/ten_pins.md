Ten Pins  
The owner, Skyre Gowan Roan is a keeper of the Forest Circle. She is a green giver, and has concerns about the ghosts and the weather. The ocean has been particularly disturbed, and even things going on the island of Kars reach her ears before anyone else in town. She also keeps a pied-a-ter in Cold Castle. The Ten Pins are kinda wavy.

Circe Moll will hang out here, Roan has given her some work in the kitchen. The One-Eyed Goat is never far.

Those that play the game would be happy to see the artifacts given to the proper folks (Kirkhall would probably be their first choice.) The aftereffects of some events requires perhaps more attention to healing that the build up. This is when they would need the party the most.
