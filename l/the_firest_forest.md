The First Wilds
Spritis of the forest have been waking up and some of them aren’t being pleasant about it. As the trees give way to the waves, they do not often go without a fight. Forest Goblins are very territorial, but are wary of fights they can’t win.

Any Ranger they are with will tell them this rule.

The Burnt Forest
There the spirits are becoming restless, and have conjoined with the dead of the island to create insanely cool monsters. Provoking the monsters is a young Stignian Fellow trying to communicate with the island spirits. There are several Pale Bears in there, stealing everything in sight so long as chaos reigns. They can choose to make friends or take them downtown.

The Salt Forest
This or tree branches covered in spelt. The Manders especially love spelt.

The Sea rises
For the last 3000 years, the sea has been rising about a foot a year, but that has begun to slow and is about to start reversing as silt is carried down the river to reestablish a new delta. The fields will be covering the old city and the old forest.


The Firest has been gathering trunks in upon themselves, and twinned with spiders and nests of frogs, but the overwhelming desire is to go, to be on the move. The heart has been held too long, the worst of the groves planted by the old king to only use to build real ships. If they can find the plans to build the ships, then they will be able to get access to the old trees themselves. Depending on how the negotiations and results of the First Fleet is, if things are going poorly for the Navy, then some miracle woods might start to appear. Stuff made like wood, stained, but it breaks strangely. It also usually attracts spiders

After the outcome of the events between the Kraken and the Natural College, either this will be chitinous resin work or this comes from some independent spiders. Either way; it makes great boats. There are now spiders and ants crawling about, building things. They seem quite sociable and wholesome, if a bit strange.
