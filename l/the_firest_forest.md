The First Wilds
Spritis of the forest have been waking up and some of them aren’t being pleasant about it. As the trees give way to the waves, they do not often go without a fight. Forest Goblins are very territorial, but are wary of fights they can’t win.

Any Ranger they are with will tell them this rule.

The Burnt Forest
There the spirits are becoming restless, and have conjoined with the dead of the island to create insanely cool monsters. Provoking the monsters is a young Stignian Fellow trying to communicate with the island spirits. There are several Pale Bears in there, stealing everything in sight so long as chaos reigns. They can choose to make friends or take them downtown.

The Salt Forest
This or tree branches covered in spelt. The Manders especially love spelt.

The Sea rises
For the last 3000 years, the sea has been rising about a foot a year, but that has begun to slow and is about to start reversing as silt is carried down the river to reestablish a new delta. The fields will be covering the old city and the old forest.
