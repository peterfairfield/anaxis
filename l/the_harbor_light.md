# The Harbor Light

## Lighthouse Island
About 2x1 miles across. The island has mostly gardens and sheep. The sheep are very small, but very fluffy and soft. It is mostly rocky, but there is a small bay by the lighthouse.

Known largely for glassmaking and boatbuilding, it has recently become a shelter for many people who have many connections in the city but who wish to still remain out of the city. And some ex-pirates. They seem really well off.
