## Kess Island
 + the Lighthouse   
 + the Tower  
 + the Harbor light

### The Glassworks

They enter a world of light and stars. They drift, but find they are walking on solid, sandy, ground. They are next to a wagon, and [Char](/p/char.md) gets in.

### The Lighthouse

There is a beautiful glass mosaic that should not be easy to find, it is a portrait of Ava Gavin, though Fred insists that it’s made up, well before the picture Char drew him, where it shows her fighting a wolf. It is a heart achingly beautiful [Elven Maiden](/p/ava.md), she is distressed, and in great danger, or whatever is going on with her at some time (her library is under attack, she is having a bad hair day, etc). 

They should quickly figure out that the lighthouse used to be a library, but a lot of the collection has been sold off. Deverre’s grandfather bought the ships that enabled them to build their trade, but he has been pushed out of the transport business and now specializes in Glass. What now replaces it is a glassworks where they do demonstrations.

### Kess Square

The flagged square is bounded by the lighthoues canal to the east and the counting-houses to the west. The northern side is DeVerre's private residence. The southern domus is keeps a public garden which leads up to the pied-a-terre of [Harper Telman](/p/telman.md). Harper is typically away, but his staff are retired pirates. 

[Siobane](/p/siobane.md) might be washing clothes in the public fountain.

## Incoming

> From the Lighthouse -- meet Fred and witness the showdown between DeVerre and 

> From the Land -- Travel with Hatchaxel, he can show them the island. They will find him trying to break into the vault.

> ***Scene***  
> Showdown between [DeVerre](/p/deverre.md) and Bols. [Bols](/p/bols.md) is trying to prove he has the right to search the houses for Hatchaxel. DeVerre has to correct him, given the status of Orphanage “Keep no blood” qualifies as a Hospital, and outside 3 miles of the city.

## Sequence
 * Bols has unleashed the Tearers on the island; he is unused to the politics of the islands, and doesn't realize how his Tearers will behave. have Several houses have already been searched.
 * Bols is embarassed. He didn't know there was a hospital here, and he wants to get it registered
 * John will interject that the canal allows a border search exception could allow them to search in hot pursuit.
 * Bols will swat him down, he will mutter something to the tune of “and by the way, we have a probable suspicion that there is heroin in transit, by some ancient code or other, so they do have the right to examine the bowels of the islanders.
 * DeVerre will point out that they are no longer looking for contraband, but a fugative, but if they could all get on with it, they could search the island together. 
 * In good faith, Deverre will invite Bols to come with him. Bols shouldn't probably deserve it at this point, but DeVerre is easy to work with.
 * DeVerre will vouch that his people are honest, but the 8 marines that guard the Lighthouse were replaced in the last month.
 * Bols will want to immediately search the lighthouse.
 * Fred will find them and see them to the Finder. Finder Phil Devere is going to want to invite them to dinner.
 * He will get excited about something they said. Perhaps Porter will mention books
 * They will notice that Char is walking around, trading stuff with people. He has just given a drawing of the lighthouse to Fred. He has given several drawings or helpful scrolls to people. 
 * Hatchaxel will notice Char and set things up and send Porter in to grab the satchel

> ***Char's Satchel*** He has in the satchel: 
 > * The Scroll of Truth
 > * The Hinge of Dividing
 > * The Chalk of Creation.
 > * The Dragon's Tooth
 >
 > He also notices that his spellbook is missing. “I brought some roots from my garden! Can you believe they’ve never seen a potato?”

## Scene
 * There is a big scary green Jade statue in the courtyard, worth a fortune. This had recently been installed by [Captain Telman](/p/harper.md). Deverre won’t understand why it wasn’t taken, unless the thief couldn’t fence it properly? And Porter is nowhere to be found…
 * Someone may decide to kill DD, if that happens, he may die.
 * Does Porter underestimate the party enough to strike hard? Maybe the first time…
 * They can be invited to Fred’s adoption ceremony. They will recount the story of how the gardener’s daughter found him in the rushes, in a boat made of asphalt and flax.

### Later on Kess Island

This is for the[ Magnus Freeman](/p/magnus.md) sequence.

Once they have reached the island, they are going to be preceded and followed by the usual: Magnus Freeman and … Who is representative of law & order on Kess, Hiram Naxas? If they are able to use Buckfest or even Reggie the Lame to get there, so much the better. Anyway, Sir Hatchaxel is on the island, guarding the Abbey keep. The 6 other members of the guard at the keep are hand-picked for their loyalty to the Host, and are more likely to kill Hatchaxel than any of the player, once they’ve found out what he has done.

### The Staged Attack

They are carrying the Hierophant in a cart, he is waylaid by Hatchaxel (of the Brotherhood of the Wolf), who makes off with the satchel (which is glowing like a fucking beacon). While the ever watchful Porter makes off with the gold. Who do they pursue? Porter has the 6 bruiser who he tries to command into the fight, but who will soon back down in confusion after 1 round of battle. They are not of the brotherhood, but are Finders. First finders of resin and wood. Reed and wooden boats, anything that will float. They will use the lighthouse to signal Hiram if Porter and/or (hopefully? staged! ) Hatchaxel escape. Hatchaxel will use the double confusion to wolf the fuck out and head down to the secret Mariner’s dock. The bruisers will tell them this if everybody backs down. Otherwise, it’s time for Bols. It’s most certainly time for Bols later, if they give chase.
