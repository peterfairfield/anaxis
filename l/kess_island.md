## Kess Island
 -- the Lighthouse   
 -- the Tower

### First time on the island

Showdown between [DeVerre](/p/deverre) and Philos, The Clerk. [Bols](/p/bols) is trying to prove he has the right to search the houses for Hatchaxel. DeVerre has to correct him, given the status of Orphanage “Keep no blood” qualifies as a Hospital, and outside 3 miles of the city.

### Sequence
> Several houses have already been searched.

> Bols is embarassed. He didn't know there was a hospital here, and he wants to get it registered

> Philos will interject that the canal allows a border search exception could allow them to search in hot pursuit.

> Bols will swat him down, he will mutter something to the tune of “and by the way, we have a probable suspicion that there is heroin in transit, by some ancient code or other, so they do have the right to examine the bowels of the islanders.

> DeVerre will point out that they are no longer looking for heroin, but a fugative, but if they could all get on with it, they could search the island together. 

> In good faith, Deverre will invite Bols to come with him. Bols shouldn't probably deserve it at this point, but DeVerre is easy to work with.

> DeVerre will vouch that his people are honest, but not the 6 marines that guard the Lighthouse.
