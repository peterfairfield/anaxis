Island of the Pyramids

The pools of chaos. They will meet with Kraus, an agent of Darker Faire who has been keeping an eye on things, he will let you know that Lord Saxon is on the island, and would meet with them.

Long Room with Strange Benches

A clerical or voting chamber, fierce hierarchy lines. Lord Saxon will have dinner in the centre and while they eat he will let them know some things they may not already know:
The Ghost Ship’s Connections.
The Natural Colleges Experiment on the Island of Pyramids.
They found a labyrinth within.
Something about the Theatre.
The Experiment has become dangerous

Whereas the Stygian’s are trying to convince them: The could be Porter or better yet, Magnus Freeman. 
There is a great evil brewing in the Pyramid. Something left from the past?
The Host will soon land and take the island. Anything we want to know about needs to be removed now!
The evil must be stemmed. – use our secret tunnel
Can you take a one-way message to contact a spy in the Host? He must come in from the cold.


Out to the Island, Captain Buckfest, or Reggie the Lame’s nephew, will ferry them cheerfully telling them stories:
The people that go to the island without it’s permission don’t live.
You can crash at his warehouse, if you want to. It’s some money if you’ve got it.
Some really really horrible take on the horrors coming out of the lake. Solidly strangely strange.
The people of the Island aren’t very friendly, if you haven’t entered their religion.
The Island is unnatural.

Once on the Island, an unrelated faction will attack them (The Rashesh?) and they will have to sort out the confusion. This is when they first encounter a chaos leak. They have rings of communication back to the Shay or Magnus. If they answer: you pour out the liquid, you see a reflection with a bird staring at you, then it flaps away to find Shay. He appears, pulling on a scarf. He might immediately contact you to the Host, or try more diplomatic channels. This is his job. Do you want him to call in the Host, at this point?

And It’s A Labyrinth!
If Char is around, he is interested in it. It’s like an archiological dig, but he has little respect for the maker. It’s just a random-dimension maze, with impossible creatures randomly appearing in every room. But, there is just a shitton of treasure. Then there is the pit trap of jelly things and the remains of the souls still lost within. Also blade traps. Every door existing the hallway. Lined with the Codicies. The Codicies are in some sort of giant ancient trap.The trap can be disabled, and they notice that it already was disabled. The Host is ahead of them, spear headed by Nate Hound and the first warpacks – a prototype hill and silver alliance, excellent at crossing rivers and cruising islands. Anyway, there is a giant wurm. Then?

What’s then is the Hounds tearing into them, not believing a word they say. If they are put down they will thank them in the morning, and probably give them a favor. If they die in the street, the Host begins to investigate them more rigorously.

Then is a big trap, a bunch of things from beyond the beyond and badies babies. The babies want to eat the minds of everything living and everything dead.

galeb duhr a – the rock itself churning beneath the chaos. The dark tower approaches. And there on the shore is the beach and the madman, writing on bits of bitumen. He is there with a Chimera. It is interested in getting out, and food, in that order. The Chimera and the Carpenter. After this encounter, the madman becomes the Carpenter, or once he has been replaced. The Chimera declares that it is no longer a Chimera and it isn’t.

Proceeding, they find [Char’s](/p/char.md) lab. They whole design palace. There are wizards of the Natural College there, conducting experiments with the tools of the designer. They are like monkeys banging on typewriters. They have found out a ton of stuff in the last 4 hours or so, but now they are beginning to get worried. There is something coming through, and they aren’t going to be able to evade it. They are like rabbits caught in a room. They are both trying to repair the apparatus, and respond viciously to anyone interrupting them. One of them is Timesick for 5 seconds ago. That is sooo sick. They would really love a break, but they are all nose to the grindstone. Ah, what is going on with you? Sorry, nothing.

If they don’t have the trust of the Natural College, they will be put through some tests?

Area 1 the research floor done as series of tests to prove what they are saying is true to the Natural College. If they kill these guys they get tons of information and tons of brimstone.

They are savagely attacked by Natural College Monks. If they best them, they win their respect. Seriously?

They think they are in a safe, well ordered lab. There the Host is encamped and trying to find it’s way out, Nathan is there, and probably [Bore](/p/bore.md)? They get wrongly jumped again? Or maybe just confusion enough to hurt? Nope! The [Halfhalls](/p/halfhalls.md) have a plant! This can be He jumps to kill them, but keeps his secrets close enough. He has things to tell them that they want to keep him alive for. He knows about the blastings, and the tools used to do it. Dispel magic, etc…
The Theatre kick the tiger. This should be a main NPC death scene, I think. Obel? Would he have been able to pose as an archmage? Magnus? if he was first in the gap, he may have survived in some way? Or perhaps they have to do a little blood spilling to get it started? I’m liking Obel, for some reason.

And.. Slaad start pouring through the gate.
