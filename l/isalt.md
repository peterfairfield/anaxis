# Isalt Island

Curved around the centre of Isalt Bay.

This might happen anytime they are with Hiram. They go to an island, find a Navy spy who has infiltrated the local folks and is able to make good introductions. They can fight or enter a challenge with the folks. There is green obsidian all the heck around, and they’ve figured out how to work it to be well nigh indestructible. They have swords of this called Amak and spear throwers. Then they find the heart of the experiment. They find inside, a Ymir spy, who has been doing work for the Stigians, but that might be hard to detect. She’ll give them a lot of help and good advice and try to escape with as much material and books as possible. Instead of an island this could take place in a warehouse in the Factory.
