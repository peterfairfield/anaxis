# The Eye


The Eye
An island with a single safeharbor, the beaches are the sunken ancient buildings, the sand below filled with wights. They are the keepers of the island, but if the players have the right credentials, they may let them pass. The mountain on the island, and then: a lake with another island. The descend into the saltiest salt flats in the world, and they start to see some totems. Several suns pass over, and they realize theyâ€™ve gone more than 8 miles. They are standing on salt and there is the corpse of an Iron Rose, and they descend into the Maw of the Gyre.
