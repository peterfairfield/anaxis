The Abbey Basement
Once they get near the Abbey where the materials are being stored, they will be set upon by members of St. Andres, patsies for the Moshka and deadly shock troops. They have been told that anyone approaches is likely an enemy, but if they know Meatus, or can get another St. Andres contact, they can avoid a big fight. The inner circle at the abbey shows signs of heavy usage of the information to gather intel on the players. The troops may be able to point them to Kirkhall. Unfortunately for the clean narrative, the Theatre will show up and try to steal as much of it as it can. They can choose from any allies they might have engaged to back them up, as well as any surviving shock troops. The Ymil tries to secret away as much info as they can, and will all but volunteer to get it.

If they can take Kessler (the agent responsible for the archive fire) alive and bring him back to trial, they will get points from the Society and The Finders. The Host isnâ€™t happy either way, but might keep their cards close.
