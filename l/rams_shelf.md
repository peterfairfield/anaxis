# Ram's Shelf
 + The Town of Sails

The Town is largely split into Nir and Emesids, each whole dabble much in the affairs of the other. The largest enterprise in town, the Melthouse Shipyards is joinedly owned by the Emeshub and the Ennunir, the leading Electors of the factions.

In the Light timeline, the Nir have recently exacted revenge on some of the most unpleasant Emesids. The Nir Court has convened and they have abducted prisoners from the Emesid controlled Crannog. The Emesids are bruised and grumpy, they consider the Nir Court an ephemerial and theatrical power.

## Rumors
* [Outlaws are lurking on the Iron Road](/e/bandit_ambush.md), waylaying groups travelling to Eschar. 
* A delegation was visiting the Crannog, they were seen leaving for Eschar, but the Records have been infiltrated over the years by the Kutha.
* The Cartwrights have been up to something strange
* The quarry has been the scene of some strangeness, lights, drinking and parties?
* The kitchens at the Black Hammer have recently burned down. They are now cooking out in the yard in makeshift cob ovens and a new firepit.
* Violent thunderstorms.

### Monestary of St. Andreas
* About five thousand people live in this agricultural powerhouse. It's about a day and a half from Ram's Shelf

### Ratsicks
* A pirate town, clinging to the edge of Ram's Shelf
* Boatwrights 

### Monah Xeres 

She is a good place for neutral ground between the two. She works for both, in a clerical role for one and a magical one for the other. She adorns the lizard warriors in Frog Parts and enchants them. The frogs believe that they will live forever in this final form.

Nir Court
 - MAYS *marks against you*: 2
 - You've helped the Emesids.
 - You've done something in the lake have you? Want a little lake in you?

The ground is covered in reed mats, covered in dirt covered in reed mats. You see wedding flowers stamped into stamped paper and all coated with mud.

Members of the Court:
 - The 3 inland isles.
  - Pyr Island has sent a delegate, which it hasn't happened since the Court was founded.
  - Weaver Island (essentially North Ram's Shelf and the Island) Seat is Bella
  - A seat for the Emeshub, as curate of Ram's Shelf (a clerical role which she loves)
  - Aunt Agnus will be presiding, but not many know that yet.

[The Emeshub](/f/the_emeshub.md)

The interim Emeshub is a very large woman from Alam with some information if they can deal with 1 MAY per slain max 3. Also, she will demand that the prisoners be returned in the same state they were taken. She assumes that the court is a sham and theature, The news about Pyr Island, and of her invitation to the Court, and even news of Aunt Agnus.

They have no idea that the instigators of the jailbreak were the Pyr island delegates, but if she learns of this, it might actually make things worse.

The Emeshub is this close to declaring martial law and tossing the Court into the lake. When she hears about Pyr:

> The Leaf Game is afoot in Ram's Shelf -- Do you think I'd tell you that if I was a part of it? That sort of thing is strictly forbidden, I've heard. The secrets they keep? Why did they come to the Court? Event: Scouring of Ram's Shelf. Vectors away!

The Emeshub will be less happy when they find out that the jailbreakers allowed Pyr delegates access to the Crannog. She might be convinced that it was her own people who granted Pyr access, but she will have some checking up to do.

She also has a beaten and half-dead Brother-in-Law, who was somehow involved in the break-in at the Crannog. He is currently stockaded in the streets.

If the party bypasses the Emeshub, she will be waiting at the mouth of the Crannog, with a couple of rough characters.

#### Ug-Zeph

Mr. Burns hands. He is a very cunning cunning man with a cunning plan. Mostly he wants his people to live and for the Emesids to leave them alone. He's seen a time when his people thrived on the lake, but now they are losing fields and fisheries to the Nir every year.

If they go through his stuff at any point, it has some really interesting work on fungus-retardants. Also "What Vinegar Does".

#### The Crannog

This building is made of stumps and bitumen-cured wood. It rests on an island of stone. The entrances yawn. Amoung the rafters, a sentry of the Pyr Delegation awaits.

His first priority will be to sound the alarm, second to run and keep doing that. The masonry is very old. They will get jumped by some of Ram's Shelf who have fallen to the games of Pyr. Some brusiers, maybe some losers. Also a will-o-wisp tries for one of them.

They come upon a tomb. It clearly held a succubus. She is now missing. 

More fanatics, this time from the ranks of the Nir Court? Some hotblooded young scions.

Then the Tomb of [Aunt Agnus](/p/aunt_agnus.md). There is a body there, of hers. It's an actual human body of Aunt Agnus, and it's alive, but sleeping. If they try to rob or harm it, it will save or lose to transfer their soul into her body. You may want to provide some RP to determine if the player is into it.

Further into the Crannog, they find a huge glass statue to the lady. Then they are either jumped by these guys:

1. Stalker Oneharm
2. Ancient Mantis Guardians
3. The Giant Guardian

Or they can take on the form of Aunt Agnus. The Guardians will obey her. 

The first actual Pyr Delegate we meet is the enigmatic Stalker Oneharm, who prompty gets into a fight with them. If Stalker wins, she will probably kill them? If they win, she will surrender.

She is there working for Undeth, but probably keeping an eye on everyone. She'll want to get to know the players if they are tough to kill.

If things look rough she will ask them to look for magical charm enchantments on her. If they dispell the charm she will bless the Blackblooded Pyr Delegates and explain that she is a sellsword from Weaver's Nets. She will surrender the passwords and anything to save her life.

She'll let them know about the traps on the door and the things that attack from the shadows. Their next fight on the island is the big one. Here is who is involved:

1. The players and perhaps Stalker, and the Big Guardian.
2. The Delegates of Pyr.
3. The Gurgis -- fanatic followers of Pyr.
