# Barrum

A palisaded barnyard and barn. Three large houses are attached to the barn, and without there are 12 more buildings, some of them quite fine.

The barn is called the threshing house and is quite big, with 2/3 of it serving as warehouse.

The barnyard becomes the stage when [Doctor Lund](/p/doctor_lund.md)'s circus arrives. First the Morris Dancers, who become hoopers who start building the stage. They obviously are Boatwights, and build a ship-shape stage. Once they are all erected, there are 3 ships in the barnyard.

The flight of the Emperor is played out. There are two ships of the enemy, and a single sleek ship -- [The Wave Finder](/l/the_wave_finder.md). The Pearled Pig becomes the island, sinking beneath waves, played by the tumblers with ribbons. The people take refuge on the ship, but they are soon pursued by the enemy. The Finders emerge from the Inn, looking bedraggled and wounded. They set about defending the palisades and shouting to each other. The other two ships have become the masts. Canvas soars overhead. 

With all of the canvas swirling round, this would be a great time to have him pick pocketed. This will keep happening until he catches on, or is out of stuff. There is a lot of hoopers, riggers, dancers and jugglers getting in his business.

Ninlil dwindles beneath the waves. There is a threnody for the lost gods, those of Mountain, Swamp, Plains, Forest and Ocean.

The chase begins, and at first the Finders are able to wriggle away. When they hit open ocean, they plunge across the waves, outstripping its pursuers. Then it finds islands, begins to nose about, but then around a bend: the black ships! They surge down upon them and the crew flees to the island, while the King is taken captive. He contrives to escape. He is closeted by the enemy. They reform their fleet and anchor off another island.

Meanwhile, the Finders are about to leap into the water to swim to the island, but then the mud people bring them reed boats. They take the reeds and paddle out to the island, and soon set upon and capture the Finder. They immediately depart, as a storm is following them into the bay. All ships battle the storm, but only the Finder survives.

You now have some string, a lump of sugar and some lint in your pockets.

Some of those guys weren't just handsy, they were downright mean. If you ask around, someone will tell you that they are new hires, all from a local town called White Fang.

 1. [The Madman](/p/madman.md), Idim Wayth. He has seen Aos. He's going to stumble around and sit down, maybe get a drink of water and lay down for a bit. Then he's going to think about how he's going to tell people. At last he decides he has to be up front about the gravity of it. When he starts shouting, the shouting starts.
