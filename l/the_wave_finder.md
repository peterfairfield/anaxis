A ghost ship has been harassing towns on the Isle of Keers. Both the Upper Halls and the Moska want to know about the nature of these "ghost"

### The Ghost Ship
> Master’s Quarters:
 * These are they
 * who ate the clay

> Commander’s Quarters:

 * An infestation of crabs, sent by the Salient Ones as introductory force come across their way. Some of the crabs have ten tackles. 
 * If Roan is confronted with knowing about the Salient Ones, she points at the masts and asks you what they remind you of? She spins her distaff, keeps it going, and slowly gives you the finger.

> The Belly of the Boat

* A lot of nasty slimy things, mostly affiliated with themselves & guts. Then, a massive trap, as the enemies of the Depths make their last gambit to disrupt the meeting. 
* They will send an assassin squad, someone New in Town. They are Buckfast they trap the players but good. 
* They appear to be posing as member of the Cult of the Depths. They have matching cloaks with hoods, like a Lamprey. 
* There are several blasters among them, maybe a gasher. As the combat goes on, stranger and stranger things begin to show themselves. They are Skum. 

> The Cargo:
They start to find out a lot about the stygian society. There are jars of strange creatures. There is gold. There is mostly a tightly packed brick of pottery; books.

The Altar
This will raise the ancient Finders from their beds. The bodies are still animate and initially hostile. “Embrace the Sea”. There is also Aunt Agnus. Her people are the single minds, which she is able to directly control. 

They could land on the Pyramid Isle and meet the nice people there before heading home.
