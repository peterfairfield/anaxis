Kars Island
The islanders are morphologically different from the mainland. They are fishy and have strange customs. They refer to the party as outsiders. They are remnants of Stigian experiments and Hiram wants to seize anything he can that will let him know what is going on. The island is volcanic, verdant and covered in ancient forest. The islanders cling to the coasts and barrier island chains surrounding the volcano bay.

There are some interesting ecosystems on the island and many herbs and drugs used by the City come from here. Spice trade is handled by the Cutters.


The Island Woods
Dark and super dangerous.There is a horrible monster thing that serves as the village protector, and obeys the crones and Captain Buckfest. In the woods is:
The remains of an ancient pact. Who sacrificed whom for what? The powers they gained may be helpful in the upcoming battle with Hiram Naxas
A map to one of the Rods. It may have already been found.
Perhaps something to do with the experiment, but only vaguely and in a creepy way.
Once they’ve explored a bit, Hiram Naxas will attack, using The Stag, but keeping his other two slower ships out to sea. The party can defend the town with whomever they can convince to fight. Hiram initially wants to wipe out the town and the Crones and discover what has gone wrong. He may find the evidence he’s looking for. He may at some point ask the village to surrender, and offer decent terms, if the Crones are handed over to the Leaf Game for trial. The Navy troops he commands are insanely good.
There is a storm that rolls in at the same time, locking everyone in the bay.
The real ghost ship might make an appearance at this time.




### The Assault of Oldport

> Hiram attacks by land and by sea. The cutter appears suddenly and without any warning from the beach, unless the party has done a lot of work to keep scouts there. 

> Edo’s Buckfest and Reggie want to repel them, and if the players join the defense, they have a chance (not really of holding off the sailors, but not likely the marines).

> Buckfest will not surrender to the pirate, but Reggie will most likely surrender and try to trap them where the crones can get at them.

> The crones will convene the game if one of them is killed.

> The players may also convince the crones to convene the game if they can get them in contact with the Natural College. Hold off on the assault as long as you can if they are trying for this option.

> If the party tries to counter attack The Stag, the aboleth slimes will engage them, if the sloops can’t get there in time.

> There is a chance the experiment will get disturbed during this fight. 

> Try not to make it too obvious, but some weird stuff goes down.

>The returned pirates will first assault The Stag, then the town, until it’s clear they are outmatched, then they flee in whatever ships they can get.

> As the Game begins explosively, have some things start to happen in the city, or maybe it’s destroyed?

> Regardless, the Stag has some very interesting cargo, if they somehow get to it. The Axis of Creation (the World), which would probably only used by the pirates or Reggie, if they get their hands on in the madness.
