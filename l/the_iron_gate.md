#### Prison

[Hair of the Dog](#hairofthedog)
 
They find someone they have had imprisoned, and they may free them. 

They will tell them a fine story, and pretend to hardly know them. The person can deliver or try to steal a cache of their stuff (like whole party’s stuff) from a cairn. There is also an indication that their mounts are missing. And worst of all, when they track down the Wagon, they find the people who had hired them to sneak them in, maybe some hired muscle if need be. This crew of folks needs to be dropped off somewhere real in particular. 

> An Ogre attacks (the Glue Edge is like this stuff that hangs around until you progress to the next step) sometimes until they do. 

Jake, who entered with the team, gives them the slip.

The Hunt: there is a cult of folks who know about the wagon and want to come and investigate it.They are joined by a very strange wizard who wants to play a game.The guy whose drink you peed in comes after you, but he is a Karen.
