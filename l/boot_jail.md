Run by a group of brothers, beholden to no particular faction, they run a tight ship. There are several encounters here:

1.  Coming to collect someone in particular, or investigating someone who might know about something.
    
2.  Meeting here with Obel. His hair is greasy and he has a large nose. Because of his role in the events of the Game, he is feeling helpful and heroic. He can tell them:
    

1.  He has been employed by the Darker Faire to seek them out and help them
    
2.  The Sun King will come to rule over all of the lands – and perhaps further beyond?
    
3.  He has already won the support of the Natural College.
    
4.  Word is the Natural College is heading to the Island.  – This time they are doing something serious.
    
5.  Haval himself is leading the expedition. The Wizard-General has gotten the authority of the University for this expedition. Now would be good times to use your intelligence counter-measures.
    

  

They know about what lays on the Dark Isle, and this should worry them a bit. 

  

Bal, the Bull-god of the Danoi, is using unusual channels to garner support.
