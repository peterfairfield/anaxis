# Halls of Aos

This is attached to the [Pact](/f/the_pact.md) adminstration building, of post-flood construction. There are four bronze bull statues and a large basin for bathing. A cat lives here, and likes to sit on the bull statues.

There is also a large shrine at the far end of the hall to the two wives of Aos, the Silver river and Cedar river. There are newer iconic representationsn of the Finders here: Eomer, Rebecca Horn, 

The story told by the halls is of the establishment of the Pact and the integration of the Danoi and Esherites into Champoi. This place also depicts the legend of the [Founding of the City](/s/the_founding_of_the_city.md).
