# Cedar Mountain

Cedar Mountain: ships, vikings, miners and shipwrights. They bring the riverboat out to the seas and find it awesome. They are intertwined with the Sea Peoples, for good or ill. 

Trade in Cedar Mountain is still king. The Defenders maintain the peace and defend the ways against bandits. The Garrison here will belong to the Host, but a very different faction. This begins when they leave the river and hit the road. The boat stops short of the port, and everyone walks into the hills. The carts take the road north. If the players have good mounts, this would be the time for them. 

When the Host finds them, they meerly take a count of them and mark it on a wedge of clay. They quickly move on, not giving an inch of road. They look fell and about their business. One of them is bloodied and another 2 have bandages. The Captain is Captain Lesure?

Over the next hill, they are ambushed by hired thugs. They are an advance party for a transport of prisoners. The prisoners are in a laundry cart. 

Bandits: "There's not any time to waste, to the caravan! Rescue the Wights!" A farmer Holder explains to them that the Mercers have abducted some local tradesmen, and they are eager to proceed to the next ambush. There may be a chance they can take it by surprise. "They've been missing for two days, so we started to put our ear to the ground and found out about the caravan. Then we got together to jump them when they came through the woods here." The last ambush is yet to come.

Mercers: We must get back to the caravan, come along with us, and do not harm these citizens any more than we have to. Perhaps we can figure this out. Things haven't been going well with the local farmers, and they cause a ruckas. 

The caravan: Turns tail or is ambushed. It is more fun to have the chase, but the ambush will go off either way. There is a mage on the laundry cart, and he has a bird familiar with him. There are three wagons with laundry on top.

At some point what is in the carts will become apparent and the mage will probably be too busy to explain why he was transporting tradesmen under some linens. He had an arrangement with the White Wolves to deliver the slaves.

[Admiral Lesure](/p/lesure.md) is disgusted and arrests him, they can wait for the slavers to show up. The people they saved are important for Bore to know about, also any clues or details about who is running the operation. Lesure acts super sus, but never makes a move or a mistake.

If they investigate they get a step closer to [Belesys](/p/belesys.md).
