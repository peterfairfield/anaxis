## Bard's College

The majority of Bard's vast collection isn't going anywhere, but all of the archives are going to begin to flow into University Library. All of the current archives are also moving to the University Library.

## The Archives

## Nice Stacks

 * Scroll of protection (aberrations)
 * Spell scroll of animate dead
 * Spell scroll of bestow curse
 * Spell scroll of dispel magic
 * Spell scroll of mass healing word
 * Spell scroll of magic circle
 * Spell scroll of remove curse
 * Spell scroll of legend lore

  ## Traitor in the Library

  They can be caught looking at certain documents, which if the players notice and subsequently examine, then allow them to stop the deadfall trap that blocks their escape. This might be done by the [Obel](/p/Obel.md) shapechanger.
