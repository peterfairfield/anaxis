# The Stables

An ancient temple in three bassilicas. The largest family home in Eshar. It is owned by [Duchess Vaunne](/p/vaunne.md).

## [Ava Gavin](/p/ava.md)

Ava has information that indicates that infiltrating the Stables will be fruitful

## [Fallstaff](/p/fallstaff.md)

Once alerted to the danger that [Tobit](/p/tobit_drake.md) poses, either when they search his place, or follow another lead, he will indicate that the stables is a place to be further investigated. He will introduce them to [Lamark](/p/lamark.md), who has a clever plan.

### The Clever Plan

Dress up as players. Duchess Vaunne loves the Theater.
