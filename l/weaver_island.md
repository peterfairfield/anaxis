Weaver Island
Freshwater island in the long lake.

#### The Weavers in the Water
There are 5 Weavers pulling fish in, and collecting them on an island, the whole island is covered in a smoky haze. The players will just be happy to get dry for a bit.

#### New in Towns
While they are talking, the New in Towns will devilishly try to toss their packs into the stream and leap down shrieking after it. They can be those snake water people. A Fathomer come to take your stuff. If the Weavers side with the Fathomers, they can be in a pretty pickle here. It would be a perfect time to introduce Esme Thornshield as an ally who saves their butts. This should otherwise be an unwinnable fight, and the weavers will suck them dry after the Fathomers extract their brains.
