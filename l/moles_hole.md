Moleâ€™s Hall  
Old druid temple, now used by the University College as a campus. The standing stones, the basilicus, and lake. The entrance to the subterranean lake caught in the rock. It is the reservoir, part of the huge water piping of the city. The place is crawling with Grimlocks, the most terrible and unspeakable things of the deep. They are in the rock.
