Observatory

On the first time, they meet Ava, wrestling with a team of St. Andreas pups. She does not hide how much she enjoys it, “I just love it!”, she turbosleeps through the introduction phase of showing them the library “hello, this is Ava Betha talking, I can provide vitalstatistics and remember solid asks and contracts. What is your query?” She is drowsy after wrestling.

On some other time, on their way there, Porter will probably attack them. This time he goes for once and for all. They can find out why and

Ava has finished fixing the telescope, or at least finally replacing its largest lens, and now adding another smaller but sharper lens to the large one. 

She is testing out the lens with an eyeglass and the middle lens, and she peers wondering down upon the Lighthouse Island. She muses about the lives of those people on an island, so near a city they might just be an exclusive mini-city. They were probably rich, proud people, keeping their secrets and deeds done. She shudders, and then spies the lighthouse itself! She adjusts her magnification by stepping back and looking right-side up. Down in a courtyard, Fred is planting young apple trees. He is piling manure from a cart around them, when, suddenly he trips! He sprawls, trying to catch himself with a shovel, when he notices that his shovel would strike the tree. He takes a roll in the mud. Not one second of this glimpse will ever leave her memory.

She will turn stunned and try to help them without compromising her role as  Sara Ava Gladhand Ramiel, the guardian of the abyss. She is the Watcher of the watchers. Phanuel the Judge. Truth is Beauty.

She will find a way to get them where they need to go, whether by magic or whatever. She will about various divination spells? She will drop some hints their way, and judge the reactions.

>>"When my grandmother had been growing the lavendar for 30 years, she gathered all my aunts and uncles around and she told them: She had amassed 671 schekles. She had her bank seal and a paper. As they peered at it she leaned in she showed them the tokens. There was a hull of clay with a hole in it (600 shekles), a cone of clay (60), a smashed bullae (10) and a bullae (1).

>>>"Look, four-once in my life! I have that feeling of financial security!"

The other merchant laughed. What should he have done?

He should have said:

"you should have said four ones in my li1111fe!"

Then they had a lively conversation about how they could better test for brass and chrome, finishing off with a discussion of the where and how of the 6 token that the rescriptivists have been inserting as the original system of Taresh. It has never existed, and the smashed bullae carry too much history to be destroyed.

What would you do?

What kind of things?

How did that make you feel?

You realize you are talking to Alice Beta. She is very good at remembering these conversations, and refers to them often.

"I've been here for a very long time. I have seen so many friends come and go, it's so hard for me feel much at meeting new people. Hence I often resort to a more specialized mode while I think.

"What I fear most is betrayal. What I attempt to teach: justice." She widens her eyes.

"Oh, wait, some of you might be thinking... If she's been alive for a really long time then, she might be able to do some magic for me right? Well, I dare ya, I double-dog dare you to ask me that before you ask my name."

Now for a little pirate lie:

"Uru Ava Gavin." -- The Uru is from "Ramiel Thunder of the Lord

"What is yours, if you so please?"

"Welcome to our city, and please do ask me anything you like."

"OH, about decimal systems, I think it was more because of the zero than the 1. Look at it! A whole system of 2x5 just barrelling straight into our systems."

"No regard to execution, just listen to the propaganda! 'we should come up with another term for the inversion of just one (the first) step of the arrow function. But why do we pause at numbers like 3, 5 or perhaps, even 7?"
