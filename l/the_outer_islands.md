## Thunder Port

This was the capital city the Empire established several centuries previous. They had selected a deepwater harbor and a large existing settlement and built a massively overplanned city and enlarged and strengthened the harbor.

The City fell to a diverse set of problems, but the final blow was the sapping of the main curtain of the city walls by the forces of Navy of Eshar.

Blaster port has now exceeded its original plan, the inhabitants have adopted and further spread the orderliness of their city streets to most facets of their lives. The sewer system in new Thunder is a further expansion on the drainage system of the original capital.
