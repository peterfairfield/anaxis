The Circle Circle

The Lake area itself has an island. Hot baths, a little lava. There is a fire circle within a circle.

This was the original temple that was destroyed by the Dragon. This was ground-zero in the dragon wars. The Reliquary Key is kept here, in 5 shrines. The shrine in question may be:

1.  The body of a Dragon
    
2.  The body of a Giant
    
3.  Something crazier. It might be interesting to have these 5 objects mirror the standing stones above.
    
4.  A place to talk
    
5.  Someone else looking for what they are looking for.
    
6.  Scalebinder Slavemaster Slimeball protecting a reliquary of unspeakable evil (wights? Zombies?) Scrolls of some strange spell. Just tons of them.
    
7.  There are tons of people who would love to know about this place
