## The Spate
 -- The Sluiceways

### Below the Tells
Huge Monster Fish and Medusas otyughs the lot. Pouring out of the depths of the reservoir. The east is controlled by the Stalkers and Karesh. The Karesh have been shoring up their bywash sluices. None of them have failed, yet.

### The Crooked Canal
You can see the wisdom of the ancients overlaid with the apology of the recent past. Bore has shored up these broken canals and reinforced those twists and turns that slowed the water during spate.

#### Dead Giant
They find a dead giant troll? Then the wind tries to kill them.

#### The Wind is All
Whatâ€™s past is flavor. I love that now they are set upon by Yetis. How are we going to sell that?
