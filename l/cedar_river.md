This river runs northwest, then breezes past the Danoi Kingdoms, then north for a while through them to turn east and north, where the Guti Herd.

### The Danoi

They come looking to find an idea. That idea is money. They have a system of money, and they need to connect it to the Danoi system. Right now, money is just the legionnaires' pay, and silver which Eshar collects. They are going to start paying the legionnaires in paper money, and they need to be sure that it is already in the market.

They have to go to another party?
