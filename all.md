There are three bodies in play:

The Council
Lord Saxon – The Head of Hospital School, The White Punchers. Master Of Ceremonies of Darker Faire. Patron of the Theatre.
Rebecca Horn – Master of Darker Faire (Harpers), also a noble Finder
Josriel Gladhand – The Right hand of the Upper Halls. She will oppose any strange magics from expedition or experiments that the Natural College has been undertaking. She is also concerned about what is going on in the Necropolis, and the lack of security there. She is very wary of Stigian enchroachments, and is almost obsessed with things Stigian.
Regent Hector Yung: Regent of the City Garrison	
Executor Bore – Executor of the University, in command of university forces and of all the forces in general. Up for his fellowship in the Stigian Society.
Chuck Fillstorm: Liaison to the Game via BRH. Healer and keeper of the refugee. He will advocate for social policies. This is kinda his meeting.
Archmage Nigel: He is from the Natural College

Musshussu: "do you see that [sic Cat]? Cats make themselves small" sratches chin. "Whenever I see a dead cat, it's bigger than it looked in life, much longer, and it's legs dangle far. They hunch themselves when they walk and can think while they talk. Some in the city say: no matter where you go, at cat is watching"

The Lords:
Queen Hazad: Of the Silver Mountain, owners of largest parts of the City, by population.
Lord Saxon: The Protection of the City and the maintenance of the Legions. 
Lord Conrad Bols: Owns much of the Lakeshore and tries to make sure that the Lake’s interests are represented. Refuses to break character, even well after they have become friends. Everyone is kinda embarrassed that he has to come to this meeting. He insists on being called “Lord Bols” and bristles at the mention of “Option”.
Prince Yung: Martial Acument. To lead the army into war, the leader of the battlefront. He has returned from the Cedar Mountain with an army of Danoi at his back, and wants to lead the charge on anything. The rebellion he had put down was one of  following the Bull god of the Eshurites. 
Lady Horn of the Harbor: The Navy and War Colleges. The Chosen. The Tameno
Princess Roma Meldrake : coming to understand that her son is still alive.
Might be a Chuck in attendance.

Onomasticon
Acheron: the acres the swamp, the lake, the frogs, the eels, the reeds, fish eggs, food. It has been there forever, remaining high and fresh above the tumult happening below, it is reluctant to give of it's sustainance. The Moon will show it otherwise. The aspect of the moon will be present when the Sun King comes, and he will fullful their prophecies by returning the moon. "behold, the moon returns and the time has come for us to leave. This Host was.."
Avernus: the mouth of the Gyre
Cocytus: the betrayers of relatives. The Finders had to take down their megalomaniac captain and tie him to the gyre, corrupting his soul, but keeping the Nation alive. There can be nothing for or above or below. "For above and below" is the motto of the Garrison of the Rock. The Gigantomachy is going on, here at the bottom of everything, rests a ship "The Wind Finder".

When they find out that the Elves came from Esh, they must be able to figure out that they are retaking what was once theirs, but they lost it to due to something. They are the traitors, the mutineers. They have decided to take their home back rather than conquer yours. They are Satan, Judas and Cain. They made off with the library, but now they have a chance at recovering the treasury. The inner circle are the Moske:

Captain: Parson Fillstorm, their 10th level mission is to get him back on his feet. He just wants to help anyone he can. But he will not abide the Servants of the Kraken (actually just Aunt Agnus).

First Mate/Doctor: Sara Ava Gladhand Ramiel, the guardian of the abyss. She is the Watcher of the watchers. Phanuel the Judge. Truth is Beauty.

Quartermaster: Lord Saxon Gabriel. In charge of the market place Kathkul Saxon & his son, the slightly misguided Fred, and he leads the Host, but doesn't seem to mind Tasha. Gabriel. When they catch up with Hatchaxel, he will surrender to Buckfest rather than flee. He will push the dropbox overboard, in the most quiet manner possible. A little rope and a little splash, but the crowsnest will have them, if anyone is up in the rigging at that point. Hiram will jibe to fling them off. Ava seeks a name that will reawaken Parson from his slumber. The eaters of stories can spread the stories they have eaten into the Blood Empires. They know not the dragons awaking there, but someone else might. Their stories awaken rebellion in the Empires, very quickly, as the goblin tribes finally organize. The high-caste Hadrad will need to be sought out and met with, hopefully without anyone dying. They are mostly greens and reds.

Boatswain: The Spider Queen herself. Natasha Roma. She is in charge, and makes a little secret of it. She is also in charge of anchors and rigging. She needs testers for the prototype. They are about to build a shitton of these things, and if they don't get the basics right, they are in deep doo doo. She needs some people put down, so be it, but the Great Fleet must be built. She wants to rollout (as does Lord Saxon) the Society to the orcs, but she plans on using the Kraken to do so, as it carries memory and stories.Ramiel. Once they can weaponize the orcs, they will have to start experiments of the vampirism and lycanthropy they've found effective with the human troops. Lord Saxon will also be very helpful in this, giving her access to weapons and creatures that she needs, until she runs into his son.

Sailing Master: Hiiram Naxas, he is a hostage from the Edo, he will come with the great fleet only if they give him good cause. He is the Pilot that can take them into the Gyre. He also knows that he needs the Silvermen and the Reedmen and the types of ships they will need to survive the Gyre. He is obsessed with bitumen and reeds. He has some kinks to work out, but is trying to debug the asphalt-reed-clay problem too much to pay attention to things like iron. If the players suggest this to him, it will Change the City. Iron of all types is going to get impounded. He is not in the Leaf Game. he does not go to the BFH. He is the pilot, he is the oathtaker. So far he has broken all oaths for his own purposes. He has quicklime and bitumen and volcanic ash and glass foam (pumice). Michael/Asamodias when it concerns Sara. He will be pushing up the rivers with the new boats and he will try to establish as many trade routes, He might also, with Rebecaa Horn's help, actually save Lagash (which stands in the middle of the long lake) from the Gyre.

Carpenter/Cooper: Rebecca Horn, creator of the buildings and codes and roads. Horn o'Roads. 

Cabin Boy: Malak Babbi Fran. Page of Cups. Raphael. God Heals, he is justice.

Powder Monkey: Mushussu, Merlin. The Eternal Man, usually appearing with a stick in his hand. He will explain the labyrith to the players, that they had luckily found a Mindflayer Prison escape attempt, and most of the humans in the prison were dressed a lot like the players, in terms of poverty and fabric. So the gith must have assumed they were attackers. He could also tell them that the two gith had become best friends and were begining to steam it up, but he'll leave the rescue mission to them. Maybe he will let them turn around and kill themselves. "Don't we kill our past selves every day?" No, I swear by St. Peter it will be fine." "It is so facinating meeting you so early, and to see what sort of place this is! This era is completely cloaked to be because of the stupid revisionists!" –Maybe when he's in his cups. He can be a little canny at times, but always truthful. He is a shapechanger. He has no side. The accusur? who is that?
There is a giant that did not betray the finders: Saraeva. She has killed seven husbands. 
The Kraken is the self-defense of the world of Eshar, against the Finders. Their library was stolen. They ambushed a well-guarded wing of the army and retrieved it, only to find that it was replaced with gold. WHat could they do with a shitton of gold? They went to build an army. She went to deal with the Kracken. Ava watches from her tower, knowing that only a Finder can find her? Is it Bore? She also pays close attention to air entraining agents and Hiram's next move. She will do her darnedest to get the captain back online, and if that means breaking into the University library by herself, then by golly she will.

Swab: Hamfist

Sailor: Samual Buckfest – of the salt and keeps to the Leaf Game. He will be the one to attack the island, and start a bad impression? YES. findreplaceme

Marine: Hector Yung He of the Virgin Fleet. His armies are packed into the rock like rats. They are learning early how to live on boats. If they come upon barracks, it will all be hammocks and perfectly fitted wood and rigging. Someone has set up a mock ship and men are being trained on it. He knows what it's going to take for the untested, untried, but he wants to make sure they have a chance to advance, work together in teams, leave no man behind. The Bulls go down as a squad, but rarely the Blood Bulls, such as Hatchaxel. Maybe Aunt Elisa helps them kill him? Hatchaxel is in a tight spot, he can feel the power coming off them, and he knows that they could be his ticket out of here, no matter who picked him up. At the last minute he realizes that Buckfest means to take him out. Aunt Elisa is more merciful. "Jump! We'll be about as soon as we can!" It is unlikely that Hatchaxel will jump in the water. He would take to the air? And risk all of the artillery of the Buckfest's Muster 



The Host:
Army: Haval Domi
Navy: 
City
Lake & Resevoirs
Silver Mountain: the Erimesh
Cedar River
Someone from the Theatre? Obel’s boss, Magnus?

The Erimesh or the Shykel Erim
Niflar Halfshield
Chief in-exile of the Silvermen. Currently working as a ring-fighter pit-fighter at The Beef Rake Hats. They kinda like him, and haven’t tried to get him killed, seriously. They don’t really know his position in the Erimesh, but they know something is up with him. If the party befriends him, he may ask them to send a message to his half brother Gloryshield. Right now in the city, most folks think that the disruption at Tell Kur is Gloryshield, who has protested them using the mines at Tell Kur.

Silar Gloryshield is willing to join up and will even begrudgingly follow orders if the Stone King arrives. He does have pressing concerns: the Empire. They’ve sent a envoy, Queen Rhesania, to visit his kingdom. She’s been buying pleasure slaves at prices that are sending the market skyrocketing. She has some bad news with her: some assassins.

On the way to Gloryshield, they may encounter an assassin, and take him for a young boy. Silar has several dressing mills, and makes the best millstones. This operation has been taken over by the Empire, and they are trying to store an army of flesh golems there. This is pretty much a bloodbath, if they go into it. If they clear out the danger, Silar will send them back to his brother, telling him that the people need him. He will send the Sword of the King as a gift.

Upon returning to Eshar from Tell Kur, there will be some folks who noticed them at the BRH – maybe the New in Towns? One of them disguises/transforms themselves into Niflar in order to collect the treasure/adze. The players may notice that it is a fake, but they may not. If not, Niflar may be dead and replaced by a doppelganger.

Esme Thornshield sees Lagash as the future of the Silvermen, and she has a plan to make that happen. The caravans must run, no matter what comes.

First Session of Council & Lords
This is hopefully a surprise, although some are more well prepared than others.

The Factory => The Copperdams they are building cofferdams to dam the Cedar River. Leader among the Copperdamns Jefth Boaz. 

The Woodsmen

The Misrayim
They typically live outside the city, taking caravans of goods, or trading on their reed boats. They are certainly considered second-class peoples by most Esharites, but they are more often than not scapegoats.

One Misresh stole from Babbi Fran (Cups)
He headed for the Hill people. Ava Gavin wants him back alive, as she doesn't think it's actually normal for them to target her. Sothis is the theif, and she has run to a pile of wild magic. She has become something strange and super magical.



One Misresh went to Market (Coins)
And has stolen some stuff from Roberto. He has been able to locate the gems, and found that they are in the Bogs. If they persue quickly, they come upon the deal going down. There are some rough characters involved (probably Pale Bears, or Tearers). Regardless they are targetted by life-sucking blight creatures.

One Misresh went to Tell (Swords)
They run into Empire troops on their way, and they find the road trapped. Eventually, they may run into some actual Ubiad nobles (giants or halfdragons in scalely plate of green) They fight in a ruined courtyard, and Athothis is held captive by them. Please have lots and lots of them in a big bloody fight. Athothis will indicate that Sothis was the one who planned the heists.

One Misresh went to Freshest Forest
This one has stolen from Fat Mat. The hounds of Bull will quickly intercept them and demand their weapons, if a patrol finds them. There is a good chance that the patrol has already been driven mad. This will be interesting, for here they meet Skyre Gowan again, but now in her native habitat. She can ask for the golden hind or somesuch for her to return Fat Mat's stuff.

Jefth Boaz
Factory Chief and President of Bolsingers College and Mecator’s Folly.

Alex Sickman
Seargent of House Beowulf

Jefth and the Tome of Bol
He will pay them well to get a contact off of Itsalt Island, near off the coast of Lakash. The contact is the merchant Samuel Farris. Jefth will commission Captain Buckfest. Farris is a complete doucheweasel. He’s stolen the Tome from the Empire, and he’s kinda smug about it. They can find out that he somehow tricked the Regent of Lakash, in fact he used blackmail. He has an annoying habit of somehow knowing everything. He is always asking awkwardly personal questions and then following them up with shocking questions. He will tell them that he has enemies everywhere, and some point on the journey, he will become convinced that a sailor on the boat hates him and wants to kill him.

The sailor on the boat hates him and is plotting to kill him, but they won’t reveal this until the rest of the crew can join them and take down the boat. The pirates come blasting out of the windward side of Kars Island, and bring a very large outrigger with aprox. 200 troops aboard. Buckfest makes a run for it, and he will reluctantly send up a signal for the Cutters, but it is too late, they cannot outrun the outrigger. The players may escape overboard, using their Deep Drafts, or they can stay and die. Buckfest will stay with the ship and will be most likely slain in the assault. If they escape, they will find the Docks and the Chippies swarming with agents of the Empire, mostly Erimesh who are mostly for hire, but also Ubiad agents. 

Skill challenge for the chase. Some Tearers add on, just for the Hunt. It is laundry day in the square, and soap gets everywhere. The horse-market is in full swing. A religious ceremony of worshippers of Obsidian blocks the path, or just a rundown Mammoth. If they are able to capture an Erimesh agent, he might be willing to tell him about his employers. The tome can be used to find an Esh artefact, the Lum, or small drinking pot, but it has to be translated, something the Empire wasn’t able to do, as it is written in Ramesh. In fact, there are few in the city who can read it and fewer who will admit it.

They will have to go to ground, but if they go to Jefth’s it has been subverted, but that might not be obvious from the outside. They will have to find a place to go to ground. Farris will recommend the most obvious enemies of the Erimesh: the oldblood Esharites, or the Finders. If they don’t want to show this asshat the Bothy, they can stay with Lady Horne or Hiram, if they have good relations with them. At some point, things will get so dicey in the city that even these powerful allies will try to smuggle them out of the city. 

If they get out, or if they start to use the book *Finders, Ava, Bore can read it), it will lead them to Kess Island, and back into the Labyrinth, at which point the book should start to freak them out. It will take them through to the artefact, but they will run into some allies (hard to say, given where/when the artefact might be/be from) who want Farris dead and the book returned to their sactuary. They have a lodestone for the book. Before they can make friends or enemies, the Empire will catch up with them, and they’ll get jumped. Xorns, guys on horses, or ethereal spiders, something that can kinda run with the Tome. The players should have a chance to retrieve it, but if they don't the lodestone will guide them.

The Artefact/Cyst
They will need the book to get at the thing, but the Empire might have started on that before they arrive. This would be a good thing to expand on. Maybe Mushussu shows up and helps them?

Inside the Artefact
The tome and rest of the Empire solids.

The Itsalt Island: 
Backhook: This might happen anytime they are with Hiram. They go to an island, find a Navy spy who has infiltrated the local folks and is able to make good introductions. They can fight or enter a challenge with the folks. There is green obsidian all the heck around, and they’ve figured out how to work it to be well nigh indestructible. They have swords of this called Amak and spear throwers. Then they find the heart of the experiment. They find inside, a Ymir spy, who has been doing work for the Stigians, but that might be hard to detect. She’ll give them a lot of help and good advice and try to escape with as much material and books as possible. Instead of an island this could take place in a warehouse in the Factory. 


Abilities
Wrangle: DC 15 to command all creatures within 30 ft. to move.

The Wolf and The Shepherd

Ideas
Backhook of Prison
Hair of the Dog: They find someone they have had imprisoned, and they may free them. They will tell them a fine story, and pretend to hardly know them.The person can deliver or try to steal a cache of their stuff (like whole party’s stuff) from a cairn. There is also an indication that their mounts are missing. And worst of all, when they track down the Wagon, they find the people who had hired them to sneak them in, maybe some hired muscle if need be. This crew of folks needs to be dropped off somewhere real in particular. An Ogre attacks (the Glue Edge is like this stuff that hangs around until you progress to the next step) sometimes until they do. Jake, who entered with the team, gives them the slip.
The Hunt: there is a cult of folks who know about the wagon and want to come and investigate it.
They are joined by a very strange wizard who wants to play a game.
The guy whose drink you peed in comes after you, but he is a Karen.


Backhook of The Books


Theodora
The Goddess of the Sea People. While the Empire has been building the legions, the Sea People have become the highest military caste. Think Prussians mixed with Spartans. Hoplites, men with swords and horses and iron. They are overwhelmingly integrated, as administration and military excellence.

The Story of Roma and Bore
They saved each other during a crisis. Bore wanted to get married, so she did, but forced him to sign a prenup, giving her essentially nothing. They cannot find the prenup in their records, so they’ve come to the library to find a way out of this.

This is a bit of how it went down: Roma had inherited a huge amount of money from her parent’s land, it was completely full of bitumen.

The Greatness of The Queen
If there is a Queen crowned in the city, it goes nuts. There are huge parades, impromptu mocking of her behavior (but in a really healthy way). The kids go bongo for the books and papers. Someone starts putting out daily broadsheets. This is like a capstone for finishing all lengths end to end, 9 or whatever through.

Capstones should not be verra bad, but certainly scary to unleash. For instance, the Queen has some integral changes of government to make. More power down the chain. Fred will tear down sections of the walls, and order the other cities in their sway to do so as well. Bore will shore up every defense possible. He will start to build a fleet. Baba Yaga will get hammered at the reception and hit on the players/Bore the whole time.

Vice Admiral Douglass has no nose, it’s made of gold and he funds the observatory, though in a micro-managed way. He keeps tons of astrological recordings, which stars would emerge first, if they started to appear? How well he predicted the positions of the planets. There was a betting pool among the scholars, which planets would be where, and which would emerge first through the cloud. It is diminishing, and heaven and earth will be rejoined.

History
I The Ancient City
II. The Library & Shipfall.(the books were on the ships). The countryside was built into legion-creating societies (a huge improvement, and ultimately consolidating power into the hands of the Reshesh. After they launched the 3 against the Outer Islands, They laid in wait and built a real navy. This was enough to keep the King of the Outer Islands at bay. When the attack comes, it will be an overwhelming force sneaking around to take the City while the main unstoppable attack (The Betrothal) beginning a war or beginning a legacy?
III. The Endless Empire & The Mechanamacy and the Gifts of the Circle King & BRH (may fight for either side) & The Wolf & The Circle & The Silver Mountain & Hoplites w/ horses.
IV. The Lament, the Odes, Lament for Ur, The Reformation.
V. The Staging, and the Introspection, the Trial, the longest chapter, the story, the one that dares you to end it.
VI. The End

The Romance
Ava will have to choose between the Sun King, or Fred. Everything else the Sun King says is credible, but this could may be become an issue for the party. What they decide will depend on them. Ava has always thought he was to be a Finder according to the prophecy. The Sun King also fits that bill. The stars seem to point to both of them. The Staff the Dagger the Bowl.

Gifts of the Circle King
First Gift: Gold.
Second Gift: The flanking Orcish assault.
Third Gift: The Kraken.

The Sun King
When he returns, he will have one speech, the Greeting and then the Pronunciation, and then the Charter. Here they are:

The Greeting
253 years ago, I first stepped on this land. I was in a terrible pickle, with enemies quickly hunting me. Climbing up the cliff face where I now stand, I beheld the sun set upon the Long Lake, and my heart was lifted by the sight of the Akaerak Poles. There surrounding the lake were fishing poles and there rested the fishermen of Cham, hailing this ragged stranger standing on their slopes. They fed me and showed me how to fish in the Binding Lake for my supper.

Later, these people took me to their sacred island which they once called the Eye. They showed me how to read the runes, and showed me how I might defeat Esh. I called for clay and quill and wrote The City. Our last act before leaving the Far Shore had been to recapture the looted library of The Mind. We carefully translated these texts into Clay and founded the Universities. In 50 years we’d built the cities and roads. Then in 100 we conquered all the land around us, and freed their people to rule under their own leadership. 50 years ago, our policies with the Northern Alliance led to our partnership. What this all led to was the creation of the greatest army I have ever seen. Those fishermen, those northern traders, of cedar and silver. Those Keepers of the Chest of Tiamat.

Now must I come to the matter at hand: so long as the moon holds the sky, the sea-road to Esh will remain open. This moon will not last long, perhaps 20 years. We will not leave these lands undefended. If we were to withdraw all armies at once, the chaos sewn in the outer reaches of the empire would be catastrophic, and the Northern Kingdoms would probably rebel. (Cheers) But I will only be taking half of all forces with me when I depart in 6 months. The rest of them will have their hands full rearming and training the next 39 waves of fleets.

These will be very difficult years, for all of us, but the fate of those going in the ships will be worse. They will face foes unimaginable, and hordes innumerable. Esh has once again gone into a horrible Expansion, and has determined that this world will become subsumed. It’s mind and will have bent our way, and only through its own weapons do we dare oppose it. There will not sail a ship without a Bindstone aboard.

Have you not felt the tug of Esh on your soul? A fatigue, a soullessness, that Mask of despair. Here I will  plant the first Iron Rose, to grow here from the city and provide it with Rose Iron. I will bind it with a blade crafted by my hand, the green glass.

The ships I have brought were built in Esh. They are lined with gold, which is more easily available there.

The first gift is gold & economic collapse. The second is the invasion of the Empire. The third is the corruption of the Kraken.

I have brought with me too much gold to put on the market all at once. Please let me know if you want to get into safely offloading a lot of gold. The first groups of people and any of their friends who are caught trying to get the gold, are going on the first ships that will begin to sail next week. The Deep and the Green are with us!

When they step up to the flint house, they see the same sight. The sun setting, the fishermen, the island. Make that experience of the Adventure to the Eye, perhaps with silly details. The King, after all, is a fool.

“Mudmen” – Slang the bad Elves use for the lesser races.

Rumors

The Fugue Parade
Broadsides published in clay tablets, rolled out by clay. There is an overabundance of paper, for some reason. The University orders huge amounts of it, and they are now letting out some of their old strategic supply.

Showdown between DeVerre and Philos, The Clerk. Bols is trying to prove he has the right to search the houses for Hatchaxel. DeVerre has to correct him, given the status of Orphanage “Keep no blood” qualifies as a Hospital, and outside 3 miles of the city.

Several houses have already been searched.

Philos will interject that the canal allows a border search exception could allow them to search in hot pursuit.

Bols will swat him down, he will mutter something to the tune of “and by the way, we have a probable suspicion that there is heroin in transit, by some ancient code or other, so they do have the right to examine the bowels of the islanders.

DeVerre will point out that they are no longer, but if they could all get on with it, they could search the island together. In good faith, he will invite Bols to come with him.

They Jump Off Their Ship
“Oi! This place looks like the sky-god sons of nurtured sons, run by a sun-god king!”
“No, look, they got paper. They have enough trees to.. To… fix the boat!”
“Awe, they have figs too! What do these people know?”
“They are going to die, and their city will fall, and the statue of the sky-god will decorate the prow of the boat.”
“That was so long ago! We were kids!”
“We didn’t even know what to do?”
“But now!”
“NOW!”
“Let’s party!”
Bruce has a story for you. He has seen most everyone he grew up with die violently. He’d kinda expected to have a village, get to know his 500 people, then get kids, get a garden. Boy that sort of thinking has been out the window, for, like a long long time. He is pushing 40 and looking awesome. He wants to know if there are any girls there.
They are super friendly and highly volatile and unbearable. They try to light the sewer on fire, then they sneak into the gardens to hunt exotic animals.
They will tell you when they join the BRH they learned some upsetting things that Bore could use to shore up the defenses of the city. He is probably 2 steps ahead of them on most and too many steps behind on:
The water situation.
The salt situation.
The black ships issue.
The Silver Mountain.
The Depths issue
BRH private secret. 

The Glassworks
They enter a world of light and stars. They drift, but find they are walking on solid, sandy, ground. They are next to a wagon, and DDD gets in.x

The Black Ships
The Boat, the Big Obvious Attacking Target.

Knots
Stories are usually told in campaigns like a string from end to end, because they are presented in a codex. These should be printed on cards, so there is no order to them, and then they guide your play.

Missing Prophet
A madman claiming to have seen Aos, was picked up outside the gates of the city by the Tearers and taken to the Necropolis, but it's rumored he is cloistered in the Kirkhalls, to try to cure his mind.
Upper Halls
The Holy City
Josriel Gladhand of the Upper Halls
The Kirkhalls
Wes Harper
Orthodox but kind, he serves as deathmarker for much of the Kirkwalls. Wes is also interested in hiring them to
Go clean out a part of the old Coombs that have been invested.
Flush out Kessler, first encounter with him?
Flush out Obel, working for the Theatre.
Flush out Musushu
Bring down Kale.
Find the Dragonwood.
Moshka Millhouse
He is the Executor’s handler and caretaker to the madman. He is a healer and primary care-giver to those who hurt themselves. He has a lot to do. There have been 2 other copycats in the town and he could use help fetching them.
He can provide helpful information about the madman and help record his ravings. He also makes note of the comings and goings of the Host to the party, whether his motives come from helping the Moshka or from a desire to oppose the Host, it isn’t clear till they see him at the Society Graduation. Aew guys, I thought you knew! All that stuff before, all made up! I have spoken to the madman! That was a ruse, all you’ve heard has been trickery! The truth is I am Aos, back from the dead!
The Madman
He wants to know about you and what you have seen. He only claims to have seen Aos, and he can't talk about it. What if it happened to you while you were talking to him, what if you suddenly realized that he was, while you were listening to him? A Messiah without a complex. The only thing to do? Do you want to kill him? I will tell you this; if you do try it, the results will be surprising. Do you want him to pretend to be nearly dangerous to his mind? Ask him what your greatest terror in the world is, he will play that thing and tempt you to look after it, like an organism that has grasped for prey again and again. To talk to them that have not only conquered worlds, but that do not want to be seen, the ones who have always left nothing of themselves behind? If they have left something behind, it most certainly is a trap. A dupe left behind to lie to them as much as possible, to tell him that he's on their side, and will ride or die! Well, let's begin the confidence game, cause this isn't my first rodeo baby! Also I have a job for you.
Ghost Ship “The Wave Finder”
A ghost ship has been harassing towns on the Isle of Keers. Both the Upper Halls and the Moska want to know about the nature of these "ghost" rumors.
The Host is Preparing
A large mustering of ships is taking place somewhere. An extra cohort is garrisoned and hidden in the Chippies. Executor Alain Bore has been tasked with keeping these troops hidden. The majority are actually being kept in the Necropolis, to the constant perturbation of the Moshka. This mustering is actually to prepare for an invasion of the isles, but it may begin to be diverted by the exhortations of the Sun King.
Necropolis: The temples of the old city, kept from urbanization with their own beauty. They have become the city of the dead. Ashes and bones in bundles.
Some Ratlings have taken up residence, and Harper will hire them to clear them out. The vampire lords are also not happy about people poking around, in particular, Tribune Chamander has connections with the Wizards, and would like to mess with them, a lot.
The Dashing Ones
There have been a rash of fights at the docks. A group of them were identifiable as being Dashing. They might be connected to murders in Workhall.
Executor
Most people know that it's "big shot", but there aren't a lot of famous ones. Seems like a new title. Some project between the naval colleges and Host.
Natasha Roma
The first time the party needs to clean up something pronto, they bring in a pro: She knows a few things, but they are very dangerous. She wields them for maximum carnage. For you:
The phases of the Moon corresponds to the ship attacks. The Keepers of the Moon have not been helpful, she could use someone higher up in the Upper Halls, which they might have made contact through their work with Kirkhalls.
She will not work directly with the Host, as most of her contacts/contracts are directly under Host persecution. She appears to be in love with Allan. She is terrified of Bees.
She has been studying bones, she has been noticing bones of a people who have lived here before.
Mal
Natasha’s handler, kinda Witcher guy. 
Mole’s Hall
Old druid temple, now used by the University College as a campus. The standing stones, the basilicus, and lake. The entrance to the subterranean lake caught in the rock. It is the reservoir, part of the huge water piping of the city. The place is crawling with Grimlocks, the most terrible and unspeakable things of the deep. They are in the rock.
The Pattern
Whenever they first are arrested for anything bigish: Alain Bore would like to talk about the Pattern. He regrets their treatment heretofore from the Host, apologizes for his underlings behavior and openly berates his superiors. The Executor notices that you are from out of town and wants you input on the pattern of in particular the lost Ship. The attacks over the years from a ghost ship that hits every 50 years. He thinks you might be off that ship.
This is just a side project, he will get back to his real job unless he can tell them anything about a site they want invesigated, infiltrated, whathaveyou, those guys are bored, and I might have a job for you right now if you've shown certain skills. Did you fireball my men? Show me that again.
Also, sometime he might mention something about the Lady of the Depths, he will then try to get them to help him take on an investigation in that arena.
Ok, back to the pattern for a sec, look at these charts of the Islands of Kess & Keers.
Parting shot: Have you talked to the Madman?

Babbi Malak Fran

An apothecary, keeps a big shop and a small shop. Learn anything professor at Finder’s. He’s an old family Prince, the Cabin Boy of the Wind Finder, Raphael, the messenger. He can provide divination spells for favors or money. Almost any question, he has the price. Or he can give you a job. Some of his jobs will include looking into the missing texts, organic or otherwise. This is the guy they should come to before going to Fillstorm. He will try to warn them off, as best he can. He vanishes into a secret hatch as soon as the Bulls show up.
He knows a good deal about the Moon.
He knows about the Iron Road.
He is aprehensive about the texts and the ghost ship.
Beef Rake Hats
These guys actually are made of cats. Here is a taste of the agenda: kissing a hag guarding a well, make clothing and nice pretty crystals, make themselves adorable, feeding you to the ape. Some spirits have survived amoung them. And in the end, they can always eat you. They work through "Chucks" to the human world.

Chuck Parson Fillstorm (an Edo)
If they ever get really sick: Healer in the Firest Forest, his blood as pure as the hills, he works to heal everyone he can. He is a very grumpy gnome. Many people dying unexpectedly in the city usually die on their way here, or not at all. Also bones that are found outside the city. This latest disaster has:

he has some things to show you about the bones:
They are human
They are not affected by any magic.
They are covered in sap.

If there are any in the group who want to join the Natural College, he will help them with the paperwork. He has been a professor there for a long time.

Hook: The Society: Find out what is going on
The Host: Find out and put it out.

Hook: The Kracken: They will save him from an attack, he will give them a writ to invite them to the college. 
At some other time he can tell them
 The tattoos on the bloodmen that attacked them were of Hozenah she of the Depths, the Tree of the Oak.
 A Fellow of the Natural College has gone missing. There has been an earthquake and it has opened up something in the bay near where they jumped in. They have to go back and see their Aunt Elisa Chuck is pretty clear she is actually his aunt. He uses “aunt” if they push him.

Coming Back to Parson, looking for Elisa:
He can tell them, and he won’t lie to them if he knows them:
He doesn’t believe the Natural College is involved (false)
He is glad that the Ten Pins has cleared it’s good name (false, he is glad they got clear)
He has found out where the Deep is. (true)
THere is an artifact of Water that has come to the city.
The Natural College doesn’t know where it is. He thinks to look down the Hole. 
He will give them potions of waterbreathing, no questions, no payment.

Coming Back for the intellect devourer
He will telll them that under no circumstances will he give up the devourer. The Bulls demand that everyone leave the premises and report outside. The entire city is shut down and martial law has been declared by the council. This is partially true, but the Host is in arms. This might be when the secret garrisons come forth. THat would be super exciting.

The Beowulf Bulls coming – they will be attacked. Parson goes on the offensive, but does not aim to kill until the Bulls escalate, which they do immediately. 

Utu-lugal
The King of the Sun.

Baraganzer - king of the Underworld, the Kraken

Kisi "Urine Pot" 

The Ghost Ship
Master’s Quarters:
Commander’s Quarters:
 An infestation of crabs, sent by the Salient Ones as introductory force come across their way. Some of the crabs have ten tackles. If Roan is confronted with knowing about the Salient Ones, she points at the masts and asks you what they remind you of? She spins her distaff, keeps it going, and slowly gives you the finger.

“The hirelings of the Salient Ones often die with a lot of personal wealth on them” – Fallstaff

The Belly of the Boat
A lot of nasty slimy things, mostly affiliated with themselves & guts. Then, a massive trap, as the enemies of the Depths make their last gambit to disrupt the meeting. They will send an assassin squad, someone New in Town. They are Buckfast they trap the players but good. They appear to be posing as member of the Cult of the Depths. They have matching cloaks with hoods, like a Lamprey. There are several blasters among them, maybe a gasher. As the combat goes on, stranger and stranger things begin to show themselves. They are Skum. 

The Cargo:
They start to find out a lot about the stygian society. There are jars of strange creatures. There is gold. There is mostly a tightly packed brick of pottery; books.

The Altar
This will raise the ancient Finders from their beds. The bodies are still animate and initially hostile. “Embrace the Sea”. There is also Aunt Agnus. Her people are the single minds, which she is able to directly control. 

They could land on the Pyramid Isle and meet the nice people there before heading home. 

Option Bols
When he can get his hands on them, he want them to do a lot of things, in kinda an order:
Get registered
Get recruited (badass fight scene)
Investigate a bunch of missing books from the Bard’s Library on Broadstreet. 
Go tell those lads that if they are going to pluck a pheasant, they’d better get a pheasant plucker. (he throws the Pall Bears some fresh meat)
He is on the lookout for undead rumors and nasty stuff coming down. Find it!
Take the Runestone and find out about the nasty stuff. He wants trophies, or whole corpses. Tainted pirates, diseased corpses, all these are welcome as well.
If he feels that the Moshkans are getting out of hand, he’ll intervene peacefully, and make diplomatic overtures
He wants you to go after something big.
He is rounding up people and you are helping or on that list?

The deck is built like the spot-it deck, with the axises being your roleplaying decisions creating the deck. Which cards the other characters in the deck are can inform what happens in game. These run throughs could be replays for old players joining the game for the first time. I think we can actually resize the deck for a 36 vs 48 NPC game. Learn some accents! If you join a long-running game, you might see someone you knew from your campaign, but in a totally different role.

Bols is a hothead and will react in six random ways.
Start lining people up, registering them and asking to see what papers they have. He will back down from this insanity when anyone points this out to him.
He will…
Etc

Martin von der Fluss
Retired captain in the Host. Runs a halfway house for old soldiers, and keeps them out of trouble. He is looking to head back home to the Silver Mountain, and will lend aid to them if they mount an expedition to the Orcs.

The Leaf Game
This game began on the island of Kars, but now has spread throughout Obaian. They are concerned with the preservation of nature and the use of magic. The sea life in the area, as well as the forest life, meet on the strand for the cojoining of the field forest river and ocean. They also invite Natasha, as their favorite townie rep. When they meet you
They will want you to stop a crime to nature, or convince you that you’re about to commit one.
Give you a title, or a “Circle”, each circle is their own axis.
Protect something from the outside
Travel to the Green House, the Navy, or something with Wildshape – these will each involve jobs. Jobs should open up, or be determined by the current vertex.
They know a lot about the moon, almost more than anyone.
Within the Elder Circle there are 3 main characters. Moon, Death, chaos Ocean


Ten Pins
The owner, Skyre Gowan Roan is a keeper of the Forest Circle. She is a green giver, and has concerns about the ghosts and the weather. The ocean has been particularly disturbed, and even things going on the island of Kars reach her ears before anyone else in town. She also keeps a pied-a-ter in Cold Castle. The Ten Pins are kinda wavy.

Skyre Roan knows that:
Elisa has been spending a lot of time in the depths and 
she sometimes gets too obsessed and in too deep with things. 
She has a knack for showing up at just the wrong time with the right motivations, but sometimes she does the opposite.
Later, when they can tell what she is Haggity hag swamp hag: 
That the givers of green don’t really have any hierarchy, but they do not ever move on their own, there must be three giver. (She was involved with Hiram’s takeover of the Island and the new beginning of the game)
She will offer whatever Bore offered and more. She knows Roma.
She has some research on the Stigians, if she feels they are safe enough. This is very cryptic.
She doesn’t know that the Edo are behind this, she knows some of them, and is surprised they are mixed up in this, if they tell her about Parson Fillstorm.
Aunt Elisa has had an old tower in Finder’s Cove for a long time, somewhere belowthe observatory. Perhaps the city lights are why the people there keep dark streets, around the observatory “For the Lady in the Tower” they will kiss their hands and wave to Ava
They may have to go into the Beef Rake Hats and beat some information out of them. It’s called “parley”

Once the City Changes, Skyre will be given a pile of free power from somewhere, and starts to freak out/ become wary. She starts to see things, but her powers can be augmented by forming a coven. Sothis or Elisa or Ava or Roma?

Who is the bad guy that Skyre Gowan needs to hunt down? A bunch of Empire Oni-cronies? The Game? We need more Game. Wraiths, Shadows, showdowns, excitement. Is it the Empress come to claim the Sun King as her consort? Or maybe someone claiming Bore as a ersatz Roma? 


Aunt Agnus (Agnatha)
She of fresh waters and hard scales. She brings many mighty gifts, and will not be deterred. 

Aunt Elsela’s Tower
Has been destroyed and defaced by the Lords and the Ladies, a nasty little group-for-hire and they are new in town.They have left a message: Heretic.

The scribbling on the walls are words of the Lady of the Depths, also madness and everything being eaten by the water. The Kraken is rising again (for the last time). 

The Kracken
“My time is ending, the sea no longer rises, I will become but a legend in the dusty old books of men and boys that play at imagination games, if all goes well, sigh.”
“Who else would you imagine would devour the world?”
“Oh, yeah, it is your choice. Can you simply allow me the pleasure of allowing everyone to make their choice in their time? I was merely reaching out to you as representatives of the city, and understood you might have influence with those above. She would greatly be interested in the givers of green and some other death cults that they know of.

She can make a pile of chitin weapons and armor, as well as plating for the hulls of ships. She scroffs at wood and speaks of the virtues of slime. Have you really thought about slime?

If they are able to intercept any messages (maybe Bore could tell them who to visit), they find out:
There is a cave in the crack, there are several ships discovered down there. This is a description of the officers quarters of the Fillstorm’s ship “The Wave Finder”
There is evidence of chaos speech all throughout the prayers for entrance into the holy of holies.
There are other Fellows of the Natural College involved. Bore will only tell you this if he trusts you. This does worry him.
“The tides will rise” is smeared in poop in the city.
“Embrace the sea”



Circe Moll will hang out here, Roan has given her some work in the kitchen. The One-Eyed Goat is never far.

Those that play the game would be happy to see the artifacts given to the proper folks (Kirkhall would probably be their first choice.) The aftereffects of some events requires perhaps more attention to healing that the build up. This is when they would need the party the most.

The Boot Jail
Run by a group of brothers, beholden to no particular faction, they run a tight ship. There are several encounters here:
Coming to collect someone in particular, or investigating someone who might know about something.
Meeting here with Obel. His hair is greasy and he has a large nose. Because of his role in the events of the Game, he is feeling helpful and heroic. He can tell them:
He has been employed by the Darker Faire to seek them out and help them
The Sun King will come to rule over all of the lands – and perhaps further beyond?
He has already won the support of the Natural College.
Word is the Natural College is heading to the Island.  – This time they are doing something serious.
Haval himself is leading the expedition. The Wizard-General has gotten the authority of the University for this expedition. Now would be good times to use your intelligence counter-measures.

They know about what lays on the Dark Isle, and this should worry them a bit. 

Bal, the Bull-god of the Danoi, is using unusual channels to garner support.

The Host

The Factory

Edo Drake – Newest initiate into the Presence. 

Hamfist Salavar
Owner of several workshops in the Factory, he also has the position of Factor within the Host, and also teaches at Beowulf. He knows of the iron road, and of the mining possibilities of the coast. His interest is the well-being of Host operations along the coast, and wants the party to find a missing merchant, Roberto Milano. Finding the merchant will make him happy. Once he has maps and funding he will need bodyguards.

Bodyguards
He needs some all of a sudden, and you find that Saad Khan has escaped the Iron Gate. He knows a lot a lot, and was able to take down Saad with a real case, but left out the part about framing Saad. 

Immediate Dangers to the City, according to Hamfast
There are 2 principle weaknesses he is aware of, the Chosen of Tiamat, of the Shadow Government, Lakesh peoples, and they elect a Queen. The current queen is behaving very unqueen, and there are very strange things going on in the Chosen. She is very young, and she believes she has visions and dreams, and seems to take certain historical interpretations of texts literally. So far, she has had success on success in her judgements. Her followers have started dressing in bright colors and 
Half Shield the 
. He knows that Bore knows about the Orc attacks. The Iron Road to the North is blocked.
He is Ironfolk, of the Silver Mountain. He is trying to get into building boats, and needs some contact with the water folks.
Bore wants something found.

Dorian 
An agent of Masque, Dorian Obel. gets caught up in this, trying to set up and betray Saad and the Chosen at the same time. Capturing this guy alive wins big warbucks, especially if they can take him alive. Bore will use him to crack the Masquerade like an egg.

More Bore
In this case, he’d like the Bindstone, which has proof of the contract between himself and Roma, or perhaps something as important. He does want to bring Saad in to appear for trial, but knows that he might need to remain in the countryside. He does want to bring him back into the fold, and possibly rehire the entire Grey Clerics, if he can find something for them to do. He’s working on it. Once he gets a Ship of the Line made, he can crew it with Grey Clerics. In the meantime, he will give them a brig.

Saad Khan
Former Kirkhall Warden Saad Khan has been imprisoned for plotting against the Upper Halls. He is actually innocent, but the hard evidence has certain forgeries on his person. He isn’t so much interested in clearing his name, but in getting out of the city in a hurry. He will work with Bore if any jobs present themselves. He resides in the desert, in exile.



If they can bring him to report to Bore, that will win some warbucks. The Grey Clerics will be put on a boat prototype as Marines.

The Chosen
She is named Ella Henning. She knows she wants to go all the way, but she is afraid of overstreching her resources. Her visions are clear: the Ocean must claim it’s own. They must return from whence they came. She has enchanted and imprisoned an Owlbear.

The Orcs
The Burning Banner – King Pyre – The Masque has given them enough information to embolden them to strike at the headwaters of the Silver River. They start with large amounts of light infantry, and then strike teams to take care of hardpoints.

Lord Saxon is already planning for the launch, but for his own reasons. He wants to pull the legions together locally to deliver more provinces to the Sea Peoples. He is doing so for whatever excuse he can. He is also spending a ton arming the army. He likes nothing better than a bunch of buttered hoplites sparing in a chalk arena.

Lord Saxon will be involved in the Mes papri debacle. The Edos will ask for a seat at the table (A college and a seat in the University). Bolsingers elevated? Who will they elect? Parson. What is the exchange exactly?

Allow the Mes to be distributed – a seat at the table (seems exploitative)
Destroy the Mes – back down from their attack. The Edos should have something to offer.

Roberto Milano
Lumber & tool merchant. Pulleys, block and tackle, and fine wood for furniture. He owns 5 wagons and a sloop.  Travels with his son, Gillamo. He has a strange medical condition that gives him chronic fevers. He keeps to the road to bring lumber from the center of the island, but he has observed the burning of several villages during his last run. He has knowledge of tides and weather from his contacts with the fisherfolk, but he hasn’t been able to locate his sloop, and suspects that it is laying low. Because ghosts.

Later, he will give them some important jobs:
Deal with some roughs, bring them to Jail.
Escort him to an Island. Meet a real sea captain.
Take and set up the rigging for the The Tar Hulk, the spider ship. First assault prototype.

He has talked to several people who claim to have seen Death stalking the island.

His son has some magical aptitude and could be recruited for College. He can form some protection spells innately. He works sometimes for Hamfast but also has an independent spice trading license.

Captain Buckfest
Brings extra surl, with a huge floppy hat and oilskins. Covered in salt. He does not like pirates or cutters. He knows the sea, weather and salt. He has spoken to the madman, as he ferried him over from the island. He has also seen the ghost ship, but doesn’t want to discuss it.

He likes knives and spirits. He hates the land, freshwater and rope. He has a sloop and a crew of 8 sailors.

Cutter Hiram Naxas
Pirate and Sealord, a servant of Edo. He has been behind most of the attacks, so far. He will probably attack the party and maybe ask questions later, if he finds them tough to crack.

He is determined to use the chaos created by the ghost ship to his advantage. He wants his marines to take the settlement and force the crones to convene the Game. He suspects someone is manipulating them, or somehow keeping them captive. He doesn’t know that Bore is using him. He will probably kill Porter if we figures out what he is doing there.

He will not be happy about Bols’ presence, but will try to move quickly to put the blame on the crones and frame their actions in the most dangerous light.

Kars Island
The islanders are morphologically different from the mainland. They are fishy and have strange customs. They refer to the party as outsiders. They are remnants of Stigian experiments and Hiram wants to seize anything he can that will let him know what is going on. The island is volcanic, verdant and covered in ancient forest. The islanders cling to the coasts and barrier island chains surrounding the volcano bay.

There are some interesting ecosystems on the island and many herbs and drugs used by the City come from here. Spice trade is handled by the Cutters.

Circe Moll
She’s been trying to get off the island for years, but has always found a reason to stay. She has apparently lived on the island her whole life, but she looks far older than she is.

She may start to hide certain things that go on, and tries to keep them from finding the Experiment, including the personal hovels of the islanders. If this doesn’t work, she will distract them somehow:
Porter’s notes carefully rehidden in his safe. They are intelligence reports about the island and it’s customs.The notes seem in proper order, but the man does not. He is addicted to a cocktail of Kars plants and fungus, 15 various hidden satchels they can find if they search the village, and appears to be mad. Porter is a very good spy for the Ymil (Roma or Bore) and their superiors in the Society. Circe knows of Porter’s role for the Ymil, but not anything of the Society project. He is there to whitewash intelligence.
Where the madman came from.
The ghost ship’s description and name.
If they do search the houses, they may notice that some of the beams of the houses are made of parts of the ship that Porter describes. Is he mocking them? Or has he met them before and makes it obvious in pantomime that he’s not a madman? He also is really fungus dependent.
House 1: a smoke house House 2: A domicile, circular with bunks. 3. Longhouse made of huge timbers 4. Another house, stone, with a cave. Some shacks.



Knight’s Trial
There was an overenthusiatic Rat Hunt that ended in an embarrassing number of bodies, which they drunkenly forgot to burn. Several Knights of the Halls are now on trial for cruelty and mismanagement.

The Island Crones
Three crones attend the pots and cook for the village. They don’t seem to leave the campfire. Their soup has been poisoned, but not by them, by Porter, in advance of the attack:
They will tell you a story (fight scene)
They will tell you something about the Sun King: He will be a shaper of glass.
They also saw the ghost ship. They can back up Porter’s story and probably add details.
They need more stuff from the forest, be a dearie and fetch it?
They can tell you where the merchant ship’s logs are. (yes, the ship of Captain Fillstorm, and the attack of the ghost ship that happened 50 years ago)
They are givers of the green – the crazy kind? 
They have recently been offered a way for them to proceed with the protection of their island with an offer of the deed from the Natural College, if they do not take their turn in the Game. It has been 7 years since their last move, and everything has been deadlocked.
They have decided to destroy the city and will not begin the leaf game. The other leaf players cannot move until they make their move.
They can fly, and eat babies.

Resolutions for this drawing:
If the party can get a contact in the Natural College higher up and introduce them to a contact of the Leaf Game, they will resolve this overarching conflict. The Natural College will get a move in the Game and the Game will go on. Otherwise, Hiram’s actions block them, although at the cost of Magd.

Hesitations: 
If there is lull, Bols can show up and start searching door to door, with a band of Tearers. He has come overland from the other end of the iron road, and may meet them there, coming the opposite way. If the marines show up, they will halt in awe and Bols will move to assist them. The sailors he has little time for, but WILL process all of the unregistered crew among them.

There is a Smokehouse it holds secrets
Salt, rocks and coal.
Some notes stuffed behind an old brick. A ship’s log.
Some normal looking byproduct of the experiment. The corpse on an Elf.
The key to the circle.
Bide a while. Smoke. They are Inner Circle, but will not convene. This is so they can continue the experiment, and build power through influence with the Society. As this is Bore’s experiment and Roma’s to clean up, a nice Fellowship ceremony might clear things up.


Salt Mine 
Horizontal cliffs covered periodically with salt, most can be harvested by hand axe.

Reggie the Lame
Disfigured by the experiment, grotesquely larger on his left side. He struggles with bouts of rage, but wants to get news to the Leaf Game, and doesn’t understand why it hasn’t started. He doesn’t know about Porter or the Crones. He won’t trust anyone who isn’t in the leaf game. He might just try to eat them, if he can’t sort it out. Reggie likes a good show of strength and a bit of the old stabby stabby.

The Island Woods
Dark and super dangerous.There is a horrible monster thing that serves as the village protector, and obeys the crones and Captain Buckfest. In the woods is:
The remains of an ancient pact. Who sacrificed whom for what? The powers they gained may be helpful in the upcoming battle with Hiram Naxas
A map to one of the Rods. It may have already been found.
Perhaps something to do with the experiment, but only vaguely and in a creepy way.
Once they’ve explored a bit, Hiram Naxas will attack, using The Stag, but keeping his other two slower ships out to sea. The party can defend the town with whomever they can convince to fight. Hiram initially wants to wipe out the town and the Crones and discover what has gone wrong. He may find the evidence he’s looking for. He may at some point ask the village to surrender, and offer decent terms, if the Crones are handed over to the Leaf Game for trial. The Navy troops he commands are insanely good.
There is a storm that rolls in at the same time, locking everyone in the bay.
The real ghost ship might make an appearance at this time.

The Assault of Oldport
Hiram attacks by land and by sea. The cutter appears suddenly and without any warning from the beach, unless the party has done a lot of work to keep scouts there. Edo’s 
Buckfest and Reggie want to repel them, and if the players join the defense, they have a chance (not really of holding off the sailors, but not likely the marines).
Buckfest will not surrender to the pirate, but Reggie will most likely surrender and try to trap them where the crones can get at them.
The crones will convene the game if one of them is killed.
The players may also convince the crones to convene the game if they can get them in contact with the Natural College. Hold off on the assault as long as you can if they are trying for this option.
If the party tries to counter attack The Stag, the aboleth slimes will engage them, if the sloops can’t get there in time.
There is a chance the experiment will get disturbed during this fight. Try not to make it too obvious, but some weird stuff goes down.
The returned pirates will first assault The Stag, then the town, until it’s clear they are outmatched, then they flee in whatever ships they can get.
As the Game begins explosively, have some things start to happen in the city, or maybe it’s destroyed?
Regardless, the Stag has some very interesting cargo, if they somehow get to it. The Axis of Creation (the World), which would probably only used by the pirates or Reggie, if they get their hands on in the madness.


Broadstreet

Bard’s Library, corner of Scholar’s Hall and Broadstreet
Sciber Meatus
Music history, musical instruction, also has a lot of books on all other subjects. The book that has been taken is “Historical Geo. Charts 113-189”, two entire shelves of books. The librarians can also tell them about the other major book theft in town: A crypt at the Observatory has been broken into and looted. They don’t know anything about why the heavy involvement of the Theatre.

Scibere Meatus, who also works as a chef at the Beef Rake Hats. He is also a martial trainer for St. Andres. He can become large, he has two modes IN and OUT. He knows that the Observatory College is under the protection of St. Andres and they will be looking into it, if Bore wants someone to knock heads with, he’ll find good company. They might be able to find out from him that several newcomers have been coming to the library, but no one of any particular note.

Ymil
Porter is working this angle and he’s trying to find a way to dump this politically on whomever caused it. He might preemptively strike the party, or hit them with a sting where it counts, if he knows them better. In any case, he will trade information on what is going on with the stolen books. He knows about the excavated missing brains.

The Theatre
They have had one of their most precious works stolen, the originals of some of their oldest plays. In particular the Defense of The Flint House & the exploits of Harn the Hammer. 

The Finders
The first of the Sea Peoples, they once ruled the city, but have recently been in decline, to the point of becoming slumlords.The Finders are also there on a CYOA operation, or rather, they want to know who did it. Steal the really important book. Now everyone in town is stealing books. There is a book stealing nightmare coming. Then the burning begins, once the Game has started.

Executor Bore
Who is innocent of stealing the books, so knows for sure it wasn’t him. Iis going to come down on everyone like a ton of bricks. He is going to make the most of this bookhunt, grabbing books he wants, executing political rivals, cleaning house upstairs and downstairs, with a pile of burning books in the middle.

The Pattern
Bore (as always) think these thefts have a pattern, once he hears of the book the Finders claim to be missing: The Seawurm’s Ship’s Logs.


The Flint House
Katelyn Wooster runs the place now. She has an interest in the history of the place, and is proud when the upper crust of the town show up occasionally to pay their respects. 


Duchess Vaunne of Beowulf. She is the Duke’s mother.

Captain Elara Whistle
Commander of Beowulf recruits. She serves under Prince Yung and the incoming forces training. She is dragonblooded. She will have something for them to do: clear out bandits on the Iron Road. She suggests they ride with a merchant (roberto? Perhaps Pathrusim the Misrayim) as bodyguards and take the route during this season, before the rains.

The bandits are digging for treasure and they’ve found some of it. They’ve been raiding for horses and caravans but have just sent some of their number back to town to buy more horses and weapons. Anyway, there is really an intellect devourer running the show. Gloryshield will have sent a group in as well, and they can confer with them or fight them to the death (this should be very deadly indeed).

What was the original object of the devourer? TBD

Josriel Gladhand
Older Commander of Upper Halls forces. Concerned with business and trade in the city. He can quickly tell when something is unusual. Factions showing up where they don’t have any business being there, the crystal vials, the new Tearer contracts. He doesn’t know about the library attacks, but he can tell them about movements of the Erimesh and the Empire. The Emperor’s name is Narsel, for instance, and he has moved very quickly in the last few years to consolidate a trade Empire and establish a route across the mountains.

Observatory
On the first time, they meet Ava, wrestling with a team of St. Andreas pups. She does not hide how much she enjoys it, “I just love it!”, she turbosleeps through the introduction phase of showing them the library “hello, this is Ava Betha talking, I can provide vitalstatistics and remember solid asks and contracts. What is your query?” She is drowsy after wrestling.
On some other time, on their way there, Porter will probably attack them. This time he goes for once and for all. They can find out why and 

Ava Gavin
A very talented professor at the University College, she operates the Observatory. She doesn't trust Meatus, but thinks of him as a brute. She is an elf with extremely fine features. She doesn’t like how the security was breached by sappers working the old diamond mines. Inspection of the rooms of missing material can tell them that someone broke in from the inside first, destroyed the protective rooms. They can find trollsign, and maybe if they are good, where the troll drop landed.

She is worried that her employer, Lord Saxon, is going to use this to force her to accept security (read spies) at the Observatory. There is a bunch of other stuff that is missing as well, magical experiments she has been conducting with her students. She doesn’t want a bunch of bafoons running around the library. If they pull off the deal with Lord Sack, she will become helpful, otherwise, she tries to get rid of them. If they can reveal the scale of attack to her, she will start to move the books to the University. She can tell them stories of the book-burnings that were halted by her family, of the missing libraries and history of Acklan and how the books were smuggled out and saved by riding out the next 400 years in a barrel sealed with bitumen.

She isn’t as keyed into the who and what of the Ymil, Society and BRC are up to, but she does know signals intelligence, and uses it to talk to Fred, with something  she believes is the Moon Child. He has been getting more and more worrisome for her, such that she’s considering a trip out to the island to find out what is going on.

Ava is an old family Finder, and has been told that she will find love among the first lords of the city.

Magnus Freeman
He is the Theatre operative in charge of finding out what they know about the missing books. He will give them a lesson in subterfuge if they give him information as well. This is what he has to share:
The book was the original diary of Keesler during the defense of the Flint House.
There were a lot of strange drawings and sigils which were never transcribed out of the book for print editions.
If they fight well when he jumps them, he will help them out, seemly out of goodwill? Perhaps he thinks they are up to something else, and wants to check them out.
His training will give you a 1d4 bonus on persuasion checks with Nobles.
He knows about the Pyramid and what the Natural College is doing. Something is obviously wrong with the information coming back from his agent.
He does not work for the Moshka.
The Moshka don’t funnel all information in the city down a gigantic tube and feed it to order for high prices.
He doesn’t know who he really works for, but he’s willing to do a job now and again to put on a new Opera.
We are going to call this, “The Skinflayer Betrayer” or “Love on the Water” “Fyre Upon The Skyye”

Edo Shawn Fallstaff
Professor at Bolsinger, He is the one missing the brains. If they go to the Flint house, they might see him having a rough day.

Shawn attended Natural College, but never made fellow and now has been tapped to begin a College of the Mind at Bolsingers. He has always been principally interested in archeology and history. He is also an Edo, but he is able to cast water-breathing (allowing him to breathe air), and has gotten used to being dry. He is a little hunchy and lizard like, in a nerdy way. 

Lamark

Lamark, is an oldblood Beowulf, wears a Lord’s Ring. He has an idea of who stole the book: The Host. He is, of course, partially right. The security surrounding the brains was obscurity, and he is quick to point out his innocence by trying his best to help them. Lamark is hiding something, however, he has imprinted several of the brains on himself and is slowly going mad, remembering stuff from the Flint House attack, and things from the diary. He is also not a real Beowulf, but is a Finder playing Hal from the Host, who need him badly. He doesn’t want them to find that out, but he's bad at keeping secrets, so he just keeps his mouth shut sometimes.

He is a collector and professor at Beowulf. Lamark began with Fallstaff at Natural College, but was hired by The Host to begin a College of the Mind at Beowulf.

Lamark will invite them to do something for house Beowulf, he might offer them a lesson in brain-archeology. His madness is mitigated by a ticture of fish guts, which he says clears his head. While they are meeting with him, he will be assassinated, and in way that will be highly suspicious. There will be warrents out all over the city, 

The Party Hunt
First, if they go charging after the assassins, please let them randomly run into a pile of Tearers, out for some blood for some reason or other. They pretty much cut loose. They will take this oppurtunity to put the players down. This could be a humorous fight until the bloodshed spreads and spreads as more Tearers join the fight. At some point, when actual Options start showing up, they will hopefully call it quits and flee.

Then it's a paper muster and patrols and the CIty goes haywire. First signs point them to Bolsinger's and professor Tobit Drake. If they go in guns blazing, they will find ample evidence that he's been spying on the Natural College and Falstaff's work. He will appear dead. If they are too agressive, his Deep Lord will protect him – maybe with enslaved guardsmen. If defeated, his spellbook and stuff are spectacular, but they will have a tough time with the Kraken if they kill him. He does keep notes of the people who assassinated Lamark, however.
If this goes well for them, throw the next encounter at them willy-nilly.

If they seem reasonable, he will talk to them, but they will be interuptted by House Beowulf bruisers looking for answers with this lead they've just been given by the assassins. They will come in at totally the wrong moment and ruin everything. Especially once they see what Tobit has been doing.

Meanwhile they've heard of another killing in the same Oevre as the assassins. It was another Edo, an insider, and probably killed down in the Harbor. They find enough to identify him as a gravedigger for Lamark, and an Edo if they know what to look for. If they linger over the body, Siobane will come over and offer to do a card reading. She slights the cards in a particular manner, denoting death rogue knight tower sun. They silver her.

The next place is the only place in town that fit the Oevre perfectly at this point: Fillstorm. They will find him frantically working on this new animal he has found: an intellect devourer. He tells them that Lamark threatened to syc his Beowulf grunts on him unless he handed it over. He threatens him with retribution from the Kraken folks if he doesn't comply. As Prime Edo, Parson knows that this guy is from Aunt Agnus. 
"He threatened everyone here. He said if I didn't have this to him tonight that I could look forward to a visit from the Beeves."

He might send them straight at her, if he's worried about her, or have them take off after the assassins, but before he can those Beowulf Beefs show up.

Showdown O'clock, when they go after the Moske hideout. There are some reasonable people there who try to talk to them about what happened, but then the assassins show up in force.

Falstaff's house is burning, probably the Flint House. If they find Falstaff he will say that this is all a cleanup on behalf of some higher-ups. He can tell them where those guys are, but they aren't going to like it.

The Rock: and killing a lot of the right people. Some of them probably get away.

St. Andreas
History, Materials Science, and Martial arts. Will admit anyone, so long as they pass the tests of Strength, Honor, and Courage. They have a very austere lifestyle, but command most of the posts in the Host and Hospital. Yung. 

The Tearers
Often Citizen bands hired for a particular effort, usually civic and violent in nature. There are glass, clay, and paper Tearers, the last a use of mustering for militia. Glass – water related, or higher paying jobs. Clay, typically delivery or escort. Paper for large-scale jobs (public works) or wartime.  They are largely built of the hill people surrounding the city, ancient enemies, the dogs of the city.
Tearer Organizations
The City Watch
Civilian Engineers
Sappers
The Clinkers
The Foresters
Braidly Brothers

Hector Yung – he is Regent
At this point, the Host will intervene and try to confiscate all of their evidence. If they resist the Tearers, they will be arrested, hopefully for something else they have done. If they allow themselves to be arrested, they can appeal to Bols, and if they manage to get an audience with him, but he’s likely to try to get them to do another  job.

If they suspect the Host, they can go back to Bard’s Library and use this information to narrow the list down. He tells them that Porter [sic] is in the archives at this time, as he was given permission from Roma to investigate. They find a dead librarian, and all hell breaks loose. They find the next step in the bowels of the Library. The librarian has a page from Kessler’s book gripped in its fist? The floors beneath them are blown up.



The Archives
Once down in the archives, there in some loot, in the form of smashed open chests and old wizards’ artifacts. They are able to track the route Kessler took by following him or Magnus Freeman (disguised as Porter). 

The Abbey Basement
Once they get near the Abbey where the materials are being stored, they will be set upon by members of St. Andres, patsies for the Moshka and deadly shock troops. They have been told that anyone approaches is likely an enemy, but if they know Meatus, or can get another St. Andres contact, they can avoid a big fight. The inner circle at the abbey shows signs of heavy usage of the information to gather intel on the players. The troops may be able to point them to Kirkhall. Unfortunately for the clean narrative, the Theatre will show up and try to steal as much of it as it can. They can choose from any allies they might have engaged to back them up, as well as any surviving shock troops. The Ymil tries to secret away as much info as they can, and will all but volunteer to get it.

If they can take Kessler (the agent responsible for the archive fire) alive and bring him back to trial, they will get points from the Society and The Finders. The Host isn’t happy either way, but might keep their cards close.

Dean Saxon
Lord Saxon is Dean of Hospital School. He also is a fellow of Natural College, also President of the Absurd in Darker Faire. The Natural College Library is going into an expansion phase, probably taking in content from the two other damaged libraries in town. He wants them to help move certain texts securely. Also helping is Bols and Ava Gavin, if she has been reconciled to the Dean, or Captain Buckfest if they need a boat.

Marius Keen
Hospitaller, half-Erimesh and Danoi. 	

The Hospitallers 
The might of Hospital School and largely supplied with Esharites. They will meet at Ten Pins for lunch. They are in competition with Falstaff, they get the wounded and he gets the maimed and insane.

Bad Weather
The Hospital University building has been hampered by bad weather

Shrine of the Sun King
Depicts the sacrifice and suffering of the Sun King.His final sacrifice and promise of return, on a ship.

Beef Rake or Ten Pins?
Large stone building
Looks like Bore is here too, With Hamfist, Hiram, Fallstaff, Lamark (if alive).They are working out the provisioning of the city and the various shortages or windfalls. They are talking shop, but mostly it sounds like Hamfist berating Bore for not Executing on certain things. The weather has gotten so bad and the flooding is only going to get worse and worse until the reservoirs burst. They are pretty certain of the Finders, but of the other side, not so much. Bore is going to issue a rest in place and find the leak. Fallstaff will look to the sanitation in the lower areas of the city. Hamfist the Factory, and keeping the water pots boiling. They consider public soup kitchens, and institute them in the barracks, the Iron Gate and Rock. 

The Sluiceways/ The Spate
Huge Monster Fish and Medusas otyughs the lot. Pouring out of the depths of the reservoir. The east is controlled by the Stalkers and Karesh. The Karesh have been shoring up their bywash sluices. None of them have failed, yet.

The Rules: when you get to a certain point in the drawings, then you can select certain characters to kill and those to spare. There is a dimension of what is inherited from the absorption of one to the other.

They could as well be against the University Library. There are two that  Roma suspects of being bad actors, Olaratmp and Glaveltmp.

The Crooked Canal
You can see the wisdom of the ancients overlaid with the apology of the recent past. Bore has shored up these broken canals and reinforced those twists and turns that slowed the water during spate.

The Weavers in the Water
There are 5 Weavers pulling fish in, and collecting them on an island, the whole island is covered in a smoky haze. The players will just be happy to get dry for a bit.
While they are talking, the New in Towns will devilishly try to toss their packs into the stream and leap down shrieking after it. They can be those snake water people. A Fathomer come to take your stuff. If the Weavers side with the Fathomers, they can be in a pretty pickle here. It would be a perfect time to introduce Esme Thornshield as an ally who saves their butts. This should otherwise be an unwinnable fight, and the weavers will suck them dry after the Fathomers extract their brains.

The Highlands
Worms – Remorhaz people. They strike like hungry insects, burning everything with fire. They have massive axes. 

Dead Giant
They find a dead giant troll? Then the wind tries to kill them.

The Wind is All
What’s past is flavor. I love that now they are set upon by Yetis. How are we going to sell that?

Yeti Backstory #1
They are the reincarnated spirits of those who have been evil and died. Closer to the truth, they are tourists and you are the Time Police. No one further in than 

Mushussu
He is a cat. He has taken a position at the Natural College Library, and has been making forgeries of ancient texts and replacing them. He has gotten sloppy and some of the originals have been discovered. The texts he was modifying have to do with the Trial.

If they search his desk: They find forgery kits and cartography tools. He has been taking his lunch at Ten Pins, which is a decent misdirection if they want to pursue the Givers of the Green, or the rest of the Leaf Game. The Leaf Game has a surprise for everyone: an ancient elemental who is about to level the Chippies.

The Rock
Bols has picked up Sarl, who was acting of a go-between for Mushussu, and has found out since the discovery of the forgeries that Mushussu (via Sarl) was using the Broken Leg as a deaddrop location. Sarl also had chalk, vellum and a flask of oil on him. Jobs might be:
Go and asses the viabillity of a defunct keep or tower as a base of operations. A large subterrain space would be great.

Ashes Grocery (owned by 
They can sometimes come here:
Get info off the ledgers: 200gp
Open an inventory inquiry.



The Broken Leg
The Theatre runs the show here, at one of the nicest eateries in town. The first time they arrive here should be before the bookburning. There is a dust-up between Navvies and two Officers, Executor Bore and Nate Hound. 

The Officers are caught without their insignia, and the Navvies pretend not to know them. Executor Bore thinks a fight is a good idea, for at this moment he wants to catch two merchants at the Broken Leg who have information he is interested in. He will goad the Navvies into a fight, but in a way that will make them look like the aggressors. He will send Mr. Allbert to keep things running smoothly. Magnus and Sarl will be the scribes who kick a bit of butt.

The players can join any side of the fight they wish, or just leave. The two Officers are worried about some of the behavior in the Host they are noticing, perhaps having to do with the Trial of the Rat Hunt. The Navvies and Bore & Nate Hound refuse to pull weapons on each other. The Officers will defend their friend (involved in the Rat Hunt), but do want to know what is happening with the cover-up. Mr. Allbert might want to arrest them, if he overhears too much. Fat Mat will whack some heads.

Hound will tell the party that Sir Hatchaxel has been getting into a lot of debt. He is a little too close to the Smallacres, the owners of the Abbey of St. Claire on Kess Island.

The chef is Fat Mat, who describes another person who often met with Mushussu and Sarl. The party may remember them from the last time they were at the Broken Leg, and things got a little rough.

Fat Mat is Moska
There is another job he has for them:
He can set them up to be framed for murder. Then the Tearers chase them all over creation, and they have to clear their name.



The Iron Gate
The main front door of the city. This is Bols’ headquarters. Some prisoners have things to say:
A caught book thief Porter: “I’m ready to talk”, he can tell you about the 
A pirate goes wild and escapes.
A prisoner who has seen a lot of people recently A lot of traffic by his cell.
Assault on the Iron Gate, with Bols in command. This is during a panic, jailbreak, or other crisis. Valuable prisoners are probably kept within, or the Regent Yung himself.
Sarl will try to charm, buy off pursuaede them from engaging in the crisis, or jump them if they are intent on following through.

Out of Town

The Hole
Bore shows them the Hole on the upper lake, where they have been dropping in objects and finding that they very quickly come out in town. Message in bottles have always shown up in town, small glass tubes that have a scroll offering 10gp for the scroll and 100gp for investigating the origin of the glass tube ‘where did it come from, to the best of your knowledge?” The tubes of glass are almost indestructible, but can be broken open with a tool. There are counterfeit glass tubes, the BRH has been just spitefully playing with the data, so much so, they are starting to get into trouble with the Theatre. The Host will use this information to hire Hiram or some other spelunkers to go down the hole.

The East Standing Stones
There is a secret reservoir beneath the standing stones, there has to be scrying or digging involved from above or spelunking from the hole? The druids had a way down there, which is known to some as sacred waters. This is the drinking water of the town. 

Guarding the lake are oozes, then some Drowned, some skeletons. The temple of Scales. 

Dorian Obel
Theatre assassin. He’ll be part of the handoff of the Egg, or the Dagger. He will enjoy trying to figure out who they are, but usually goes with the most ridiculous theories. He will
Hand off a fake.
They will set him up to plant a tracer on him.
Verify their bona fides and then attack.
They will be employed by the Beef Rake Hats to take him out.
Sell them what they were actually looking for.

He is a very good assassin, not as smart as he thinks you are.

Darker Faire
They might be on the streets, or down by the lake, as the Faire does know about the history of the town. They are happy to let the Host discover and build defenses to deal with an outside threat, but they are beginning to suspect that something else is up. They will want to reseed false data back to the Host about the tags.
Bags of tags. They re hired to trade tags for tags. The tags are all sorted and stacked. They meet and exchange bags with other bagment (all of whom end up dead because they gave the tags to the wrong people.) Somehow set them up all fancy to look like they are War College students or some such?
If Bore catches them, he’s likely to overlook the real confusion (that the tags are being mesesed with) because he’s so excited to get the players to work for him.
Someone legit wants to buy something dangerous like nitric acid (for making guncotton). They will test the nitric acid by dissolving copper in it. Very concentrated nitric acid will fume when air is blown on it and will not dissolve copper until it is diluted.
The Opera is being replaced with more Host-friendly content managers. This will not stand.


 
The Circle Circle
The Lake area itself has an island. Hot baths, a little lava. There is a fire circle within a circle.
This was the original temple that was destroyed by the Dragon. This was ground-zero in the dragon wars. The Reliquary Key is kept here, in 5 shrines. The shrine in question may be:
The body of a Dragon
The body of a Giant
Something crazier. It might be interesting to have these 5 objects mirror the standing stones above.
A place to talk
Someone else looking for what they are looking for.
Scalebinder Slavemaster Slimeball protecting a reliquary of unspeakable evil (wights? Zombies?) Scrolls of some strange spell. Just tons of them.
There are tons of people who would love to know about this place

Sargent Horne
He is an old Sargent. Dirty as the day is long, absolutely indispensable, he works for everyone and has a price for anything. He only works for the Ymil more than anyone else because he is afraid of them. He is sweet on Roma and works his tush off to impress her.
Lady Horne and the Painting of the Windfinder
There is a exhibition of art at the Fleet School Keep, and the Lady Horne has invited the public to come and view them. The pieces are from most of the finest artists, living and dead. They depict the history of Eshar, from the fall of the old city (now Tell Kur) , the drowned city Eabakzu, and the city of the Sun. Then: the Windfinder coming into the city in tatters, and the coming of the Danoi and the Silvermen. Lady Horne is of an old Esherite blood.
Event: Revellers visit, overdressed, and dump their coats and stuff in a makeshift coat closet, leaving a drunken team of guards.
Event: Dancing and music, there are several people to meet here:
Admiral Josriel
Hiram Naxas – dances with Lady Horne
Fat Mat – catering?
Nobles: Prime Eduward, John Deverre, Yuri Holden, Duchess Vaunne of Beowulf, Lord Saxon, and many lesser lights.
The non-nobles seem to know to stay away from the party.
Event: A servent or someone throws nitric acid on Lady Horne
Event: The servent is arrested, but she obviously seems confused. She keeps talking about they painting of the Windfinder.
Event: They catch up with the painter, and something goes down, if they fail, a large portion of the city is destroyed.

Prime Eduward
Principle of Fleet School, a damn charming man. His mistress is likely the thrower of acid.

Kess Island
Once they have reached the island, they are going to be preceded and followed by the usual: Magnus Freeman and … Who is representative of law & order on Kess, Hiram Naxas? If they are able to use Buckfest or even Reggie the Lame to get there, so much the better. Anyway, Sir Hatchaxel is on the island, guarding the Abbey keep. The 6 other members of the guard at the keep are hand-picked for their loyalty to the Host, and are more likely to kill Hatchaxel than any of the player, once they’ve found out what he has done.

The Keep Grounds
This is where the guard runs practice rounds with each other, study and keep watch over the east side of the Island. They also tend to the beacon, and send signals to the Observatory. One of them Fred, is in love with an Elf Maiden he has never seen.

John Deverre
The owner of the island, a Finder with little care for the city, but mostly ignorant of the outside world. He keeps a strange menagerie of pets, including a Hippo. He is indulgent, friendly and a little debauched. He has heard of a great family treasure hidden on the island, or even within the keep. If he learns that it has opened up, he will want to investigate. He has no authority over the guards, but he will try to appeal to Hatchaxel, who is a newcomer. If he is killed and they go through his collection there are bound to be books to return to Bard’s or University Libraries. Some of them would enhance their collection, and be worth a pretty finder’s fee. He is obviously an old believer.

Porter
He is there after the same clues as the party, or is there for the books – or to keep an eye on Hatchaxl, perhaps to aid him in his escape? Hatchaxel has gotten permission from the Ymil that he is to be allowed to escape. Thence the Host gets to sweep his testimony under the rug, and the Ymil get the books. They will find these books or not, depending on how far Hatchaxel gets. Porter brings a pleasure yacht for this one, posing as a nobleman’s TBD servant. He is travelling under the name “Porter” “Iorick’, “Yarvik”, “Aos”. He is using his cover as curator of the University Library, under Lord Saxon. He will tip them off to some of the Orc activities or anything obviously threatening to the Society. 

Hatchaxel
He’ll try to use the confusion of their arrival to snatch the gold and run it. He’ll have paid the Ymil for a boat and supplies. He will deliver the books/and or gold into the boat and meet up with them on Crow Island. He can get the gold to the harbor via a the old canal. Anyone noticing this detail will have to be jumped on by “Porter” and convinced that he had nothing to do with it, he was just following old protocols. He will try to slip in and snatch the books if Hatchaxel can’t get them out, if he can do without blowing cover.

Sea Cave

Hiram Naxas
Is intense. If he hears that Hatchaxel is on the run, he will run them down with his seawolves. He will overtake the yacht, take her or sink her. His mania and cannon cojoin in such beauty, you realize he a thing of the sea itself, a spirit of thunder and lightening, waves and wind.


Char
And the entrance to the labyrinth. He will remember them as before, or not at all, at some point. If he is killed, the doors around him open. Meanwhile, he will go into town for fresh eggs, and open a woodshop in the Keep Grounds. The town around the keep are very well-to-do glassbowers. Deverre should have some close scrapes, but be a steadfast friend.

The Lighthouse
There is a beautiful glass mosaic that should not be easy to find, it is a portrait of Ava Gavin, though Fred insists that it’s made up, well before the picture Char drew him, where it shows her fighting a wolf. It is a heart achingly beautiful Elven Maiden, she is distressed, and in great danger, or whatever is going on with her at some time (her library is under attack, she is having a bad hair day, etc). They should quickly figure out that the lighthouse used to be a library, but a lot of the collection has been sold off. Deverre’s grandfather bought the ships that enabled them to build their trade, but he has been pushed out of the transport business and now specializes in Glass. What now replaces it is a glassworks where they do demonstrations.

Things can go several ways either they can meet with Fred or with Siobane, or Hatchaxel, depending. If it is Siobane they will meet her at a street washing fountian, cleaning up bloodly clothes. If they intend to go into the city, they will need clothes and they might notice that these are the clothes that Deverre gives them to wear. If asked, she says that the blood is pomegranate juice from a recent juicing and rendering to make gullack, or pomegranate wine. She might ask them to gather firewood for a fire to help get the stains out. Skill challege, or ignore the old lady.

Events can go:
Arrive and meet Char, meet something nasty on the island.
Wander into small stone village, larger ruined castle, well kept keep in town.
Hatchaxel (later Fred) will find them and see them to the Finder. Finder John Devere is going to want to invite them to dinner.
He will get excited about something they said. Perhaps Porter will mention books
They will notice that Char is walking around, trading stuff with people. He has just given a drawing of the lighthouse to Fred. He has given several drawings or helpful scrolls to people. He has in the bag: The Scroll of Truth, The  Hinge of Dividing, and The Chalk of Creation. He also notices that his spellbook is missing. “I brought some roots from my garden! Can you believe they’ve never seen a potato?”
There is a big scary green Jade statue in the courtyard, worth a fortune. Deverre won’t understand why it wasn’t taken, unless the thief couldn’t fence it properly? And Porter is nowhere to be found…
Someone may decide to kill DD, if that happens, he dies.
Hatchaxel will dive in, make off with the satchel (no, but Porter?)l, the books, and the gold? Does Porter underestimate the party enough to strike hard? Maybe the first time…
They can be invited to Fred’s adoption ceremony. They will recount the story of how the gardener’s daughter found him in the rushes, in a boat made of asphalt and flax.

On the Streets:
An Acceptance ceremony, where a poor kid gets their acceptance. When the Cursors and sent though, Bols will clear the streets, and if the players succeed in helping him prevent a stampede, providing him with an opportunity to congratulate them on meeting them during non-violent times.
Pamphlets advertising to be spells nearly finished. “Torn Papers” Anyone showing up for work were able to find the other half of the scroll.
House Beowulf romps about town, a Finder or BRH will put them in place. 

Back at the Flint House some Time:
They will run into Bors, and after ceding neutral territory. He will tell them that he’s worried about his superiors in the Host, and he is at a loss whom to trust.
“Option Tyranny” Bols tells them that there are rumors that the Iron Gate is compromised, and there is a ton of powerful movement around his superiors. 
He suspects it is more like favors for information.
A suspect in custody for trial (probably someone like Hatchaxel, Surl, or Porter), but there has been strange security changes.
The security of Beowulf Castle has been tightened.

Corner Scholar’s Hall (St. Andreas)
Dress Shoppe run by Magnus
During the panic, this will be a nexus of messaging operations for the Society. Theatre couriers running to and fro.
If the players need to get out of town, the Theatre can move them out in a travelling circus, or if they have to, smuggle them out through their contacts in the harbor. 
The Theatre has some other secrets.
During crisis: there is a big fight here, it would be nice to have a map. Perhaps the cards are map tiles, with sigils on them. The fight should threaten the life or end the life of a close ally (Bols, for instance). Here are some examples
Transporting Prisoners – a cart of prisoners, perhaps the town council, maybe some enemies of the city?
If Ava is part of the prisoners or conflict, she can tell them about the state of the attack that is going on. There are 2 attacks, the big loud one and the quieter one. She knows more about the big loud one and its characteristics.
A total mistaken identity that is going to cause mayhem.
Everybody knows where the big attack is coming. 
Esme Thornshield – she will help guard the helpless, if they can help her out.

Core idea, people, places, story, scene (encounter could only be half an option). Time (from one to another). These is everything that is actually data coming into the machine. Each piece of data should be treated with respect, and allowed to build another dimension of the information. I should instantiate a model for each of these objects, leave no cross tables unstoried, placed or peopled. You can actually start a deck with just Story, and then add the others (they are all story) but as more cards get added, they can just expand in symbols. Encounters should maybe be triggered by DM fiat, if they fit the mood and power level of the players.

Internecine conflict between Kirkhalls and the Host.
The fundamental issue: has Aos returned, or is this all a lie?
Aos in death vs Aos alive. Some things were supposed to happen when Aos returned. For some, they are obviously happening, but to others, these events seem fake and manufactured to trick the faithful.
The Sun King as Ancestor or Usurper. This is when the Upper Halls become clearly Elven. Maybe the players have noticed all along.



Beowulf Castle
There is a gather of many important people to deal with an issue in the city, and it is under attack.
There is a big looking attack distracting from the Ymil. No one really knows why later.
The Sun King Lands,  takes up the chalice and plants the Iron Rose.

A Monster on the Loose
How does the city react to a large monster attack? Here are some monsters:
Dragon: ???
Aboleth: ???

Belesys
Danoi governer of the Empire's closest providence. He is largely a figurehead and "familiar face" for the Empire. He is aware of the delicate situation he is in, and will probably go with whomever will give him the best chance of living.

The Chippies
Piled docks, warehouses built from derelicts and vice versa.The buildings that were once built from ships (when the Navy was parked to make the first Inner Schools), are now emulated throughout the Schools and Harbor districts.

During high Chaos (panic or book-burnings) these actions can be taken in the Chippies:
A ship can be rescued
A ship can be sabotaged
There are 3 longshoremen. Higgs, Facks, and Jame
There is a place called Fiddler’s Green
 

The Byres
Run by the Kirkhalls – a free funeral service with full burial or cremation. The poorer classes typically choose cremation and the richer, older families burial. It seems a point of pride for each.

Kraken Hunt
At some point, there should be a Kraken Hunt. Maybe something a little ridiculous like setting up the party to kill the Kraken on their own, with the right equipment. Maybe someone gives them the right equipment?

The First Wilds
Spritis of the forest have been waking up and some of them aren’t being pleasant about it. As the trees give way to the waves, they do not often go without a fight. Forest Goblins are very territorial, but are wary of fights they can’t win.

Any Ranger they are with will tell them this rule.

The Burnt Forest
There the spirits are becoming restless, and have conjoined with the dead of the island to create insanely cool monsters. Provoking the monsters is a young Stignian Fellow trying to communicate with the island spirits. There are several Pale Bears in there, stealing everything in sight so long as chaos reigns. They can choose to make friends or take them downtown.

The Salt Forest
This or tree branches covered in spelt. The Manders especially love spelt.

The Sea rises
For the last 3000 years, the sea has been rising about a foot a year, but that has begun to slow and is about to start reversing as silt is carried down the river to reestablish a new delta. The fields will be covering the old city and the old forest.

Tarside and Lymeside
Tarside is also called Ooze or Slimeside and Limeside is called Shellies or Oysters. 
The plain below the City extends to the West, a chain of fertile farms still supply the city with ample food, it is populated and farmed by the people who have traveled up the valley. It is overpopulated, culturally different from the city and very angry. They are the fair folk, and the city dwellers are the Blackheads.

Trade in Bitumen  - This is in competition with Lime

Trade in Salt (the lower salt city is an excellent place to collect it.)

Trade in Oyster Shells – do these end up in lime ricks (cement) or sent to the Nakers (to be rendered into mother of pearl for magical purposes) Oyster Cultch or sets are also made with perforated shells on string.

Wood – This is going to be a major concern for the Inner Colleges and the Host. They will have already had contacts for for wood for ships and the city, but suddenly there is a huge desire for wood as the defenses are built up. This is combined with the feeling that all of the islands are sinking anyway, so why not harvest the wood now? This is countermanded when the players find ancient records indicating that the rate of ocean rise has been slowing considerably.

The other problem is that the Elven written language is largely unreadable. There have been attempts at translation, but they haven’t taken widespread hold. The Elves have considered it sacrilegious to use use phonetic transcription of words. There is a symbolic understanding of the words which is lost. Meanwhile the people of the city don’t know how to make wine.

Some things have been shared, the making of bread, wine, cheese and pottery? Let’s think about this one. The Finders brought brewing. The Society brought banking.

Banks:
Obsidian Temple –  The Stigian Society’s public bank & moneychangers, Foreign Exchange.
House Beowulf – Quasi private university bank
House of Mushushu – Land management banking, seed, land taxes, subletting 'bow land', or land held by a compbination of military service and taxes. Their loans typically allow landowners to pay taxes in silver.
The Copperdams – private bank, associated with Bolsingers
Ubaiad Imperial Post – Large trade bank of the Empire, they have a presence in the city, but are illegal there.


The Bowl is made of Clay
The Dagger is made of iron
The Eye is made of tar.
The Staff is made of wood

Mills. Wood vs flour

Food Hasira. Flour from the west, grapes and exotic cultivars from the islands. Figs.

Sand Stone

Rose Iron

Copper & Tin & Silver from the river. Cedar from the river as well. “As far as the silver mines” – quite far away.

Iron & Slag (vs Slime)

Reeds
These are everywhere, mats cover the ground inside for the heat, and in the market.

Lime Stone
Burnt in lime kilns used to heat the baths.

Terpen Resin
Like in the past, someone’s going to get buried in amber. Balm, the oil of Giliad. Dragon’s Blood, the blood of elephants slain in mortal combat. Pitch made over rosin.

Far Away Peoples
Lapus and other gemstones, spices and crafts. 

Lagash, the Tip of the Ubiad Empire. A slaving hub, taking hill people and exporting them. Now they have been double dipping into boggers.

The Guti
Wolves among the sheep. From the silver mountain. They are moving down the river, taking and holding cities.

The Tarash
The Keepers of the city. Worships the city. They build with brick and tar, their city was upon the lake lower side, where The Finders.

The Tarash Throw a Party
The Danoi prefix all rivers with an-
The Danoi Throw a Party
Danoi Party
Hostess: Argia Hermia Saxon 
Security: Inajon Teledice – big bouncer, maybe employer?
Servers:
Cooks:
Spices:
Spies:
Footman: Paul friendly, talkative. 
This is thrown in a Tarash style, as the ancients would have partied, on the rooftops. In fact, this has been a trend in town, as rooftop canteens have begun to crop up, and old places get rediscovered. This is an old hanging garden, completely recreating the palaces of old. There is a professor from Bolsingers and St. Andreas. Shawn Fallstaff will be doing what spellbinding can be done about the history of the ancients, while Boaz chuckles at his mistakes, and might even drop something deep and heavy on the players, depending on where they are.
Event: Someone kidnaps Fred. Bore takes it personally, and has the players intervene.
That same someone is going to sacrifice Fred to the dark gods. They have probably duped a bunch of people into being their lackeys.
They find the dying bodies of security folks.
The bad guy gets away because of a McGuffin ball
Event: Admiral Lesure will be complaining that his son is going to marry a werewolf.
The werewolf’s family is super sketchy, but doesn’t know what’s going on with her
Other than she’s been attending a lot of lectures by Professor Unnatural
This leads them to a professor of the Unnatural who is captured by the werewolf’s family
Who is going to do some bad things to the Professor, unless they can be cooled down.
Event: Help Fat Mat in the kitchen. 
During the party, Mat’s place is going to get hit, and he’s more than happy if they could run by and find out who is up to no good. 
And it is bad. It is badgers gone bad. If the party doesn’t intervene, the badgers are going to shit all over the place.
If they encounter the bad badgers, they find that the badgers are after Mat’s desk, and may have already copied some stuff from it. The badgers act like they were total marauders. 
They may find some clues to who hired the badgers, but it should be subtle, probably St. Andreas. If you want things to get involved, maybe some ankegs?
Event: They have to rescue a pet that went down a hole. There is a really deep fountain, and a beloved turtle fell down it. 
If they can and do go down in the drain, this may be their first introduction to the reservoir.
The turtle is getting jumped by giant frogs. There are some magical sigils.


Event: They are asked to escort a dangerous guest out of the party. 
They are of course attacked on their way out. The Saxons would prefer that the fight happen outside. 
Professor Human Mesius would be an excellent candidate, as there are plenty of people who want to kill him, and he could probably use some friends.
He will hopefully be more forthright with them if they believe him. Also, he may do some things that save lives.

Each of the vignettes at the party should be connected by some thread. The Frednapping, the Admiral’s son, Fat Mat, the Turtle and Mesius.


Professor Human Mesius Warlock of the Pact
A very studious man, a mediocre speaker, but he ignites audiences with his writing. His “Laws of the City” in which he points out that there are 4 systems of law in the city, and they should be applied geographically, rather than they are now. His system is widely read and referenced by Judges in the city. He is a Lich, and a Fellow of the Society, but he does have a passion for the Pact.

The Kush
The mountain people from above the lake. They have always been there. The salamanders are counted among them, the wolves have long been their servants. The party will have to negotiate a power move to bring the animals in harmony. They will have to show them that they are not on the same side as the Masters.

College of the Library
A place obsessed with writing things down. Ugaric a city stricken by the Divorce, the heads of research, they are obsessed with the past and the “big shakers and movers” – the people who write the history. They sing the laudes of the kings of before. The greater and more bombastic, like the Assirians, the better. They will need to see the real people and consequences. Ava will present them a perspective from her high tower.

Is the triangle Bore Ava and Fred? Straight choice, with maybe some mutual respect available to the players? Always present them with an easier choice if they betray the other. Ava might go looking for Fred. 

About around time she decides to come looking, he wants to remain hidden. He will enter the city and it will Change, the three events that Change the City are: Queen, King, and Marriage. Fred will be opposed by the Finders, the Host and the Colleges.

As the cards come up, there is a lean you can pull from each card (maybe the front side) the backside is all of the other rules. He is going to pull up and wreck some house. Fred Halfelven will hit all of the major trade goods, all guilds and and artisans. The triumph of the Egyptians over the sea peoples, the barbarians. The great and venereal society of the Most Ancient City. They are the ones trying to stab Fred in the back. The Opera will start this message, and imprint it in the minds of those. Fred has enemies among his own faction, those who are trying to rewrite history, and erase the phonetic sylvan.

Fred’ sacrifice is to die to the group of his own people who don’t want their written system eradicated. Fred begins to compose screeds that are wildly read throughout the Chippies and the Forest. He has some really good things to point out about what is going on. He is a Finder in name, and with the help of other Finders, the party might be able to bring the more radical elements to the table: perhaps a meeting between the Society and a Giver of Green?

The major texts are taken out by the bulldozers. They only came to smash, not to grab. This rubble can be reconstructed to find the life blood of information. They might meet Roma. “You know, the advantage of my line of work is, people can never be sure that it might not be the case that…  are working for me or with me? or not?” What is written and recorded about her movements. She is new chaos leaking off her.

“I’m a spy for the biggest, most nefarious organization you can imagine, by like 1 billion times, or some big big number. Sorry I’m babbling. You must understand, that is one damn good cover (wink).”

“Do you know who you work for. Maybe: do you know who you work for?”

“Are you insulted by the question?”

“I think we might be able to work together” Iron. Iron until 500 years ago we had iron. There is an Iron Gate to the city. We were pulling up raw nickel iron from a vein, and that built the steel of the city. But then came cheaper iron, found everywhere. Cheap iron. Anyone with cash could summon an unstoppable army, and oh look someone did. I’m working on behalf of the people who would try to make things more pleasant for everyone.”

“Speaking of which, gotta work, I’ll see you guys in my offtime, you seen like a real nice bunch, but gotta, gotta go…”

“Call me Queen, I like it!”

The choice in the city is whether to unite the reactive elements (the Ymil vs the Witches, and yes she is working for both), Bore has just been promoted to President of the War College, and the boys were feeling punchy and decided to have a Rat Hunt. Bore has court-martialed all of the middle command with extreme vigor and has replaced them from the Society. He has done this with a really old rule of the city, and is expected to be challenged in court. He is also going through a divorce with the Roma.

Meanwhile Char has applied at the bar.
 
“You found a way out! You! You did it! We are free! Look, if I ram my head into a wall, it hurts! He suffers a concussion and has to be carried. They find a cart, made for hauling  glass nearby. He wants food. Real food! I’ve got money! We can do this!”

“Oh yeah, I grabbed some things. This place is so unexpected. I’ve got to talk to someone, I wonder if they speak our language?”

“Are they even human? What are they gonna look like? Are we talkin’ fish things, rabbit peoples? We going whole hog on the “axolotls are more commonplace than we thought?” 

The Staged

They are carrying the Hierophant in a cart, he is waylaid by Hatchaxel (of the Brotherhood of the Wolf), who makes off with the satchel (which is glowing like a fucking beacon). While the ever watchful Porter makes off with the gold. Who do they pursue? Porter has the 6 bruiser who he tries to command into the fight, but who will soon back down in confusion after 1 round of battle. They are not of the brotherhood, but are Finders. First finders of resin and wood. Reed and wooden  boats, anything that will float. They will use the lighthouse to signal Hiram if Porter and/or (hopefully? staged! ) Hatchaxel escape. Hatchaxel will use the double confusion to wolf the fuck out and head down to the secret Mariner’s dock. The bruisers will tell them this if everybody backs down. Otherwise, it’s time for Bols. It’s most certainly time for Bols later, if they give chase.

Hiram
He want them to raise sails fore and aft. He explains running-rigging like this “you have to feel which way the rope doesn’t want to go and make it go.”

He then later, when the weather does a crazy turn. Square sails! Every inch up top! And take down the gaff. She likes flying straight over the ways, Keep an eye on your lines!“ And he spins the wheel, ties it to a rope around his foot and jumps to the rescue. He is clearly awesome.

Then he tosses them each a potion, while they stand in the sudden calm of the deck. All of the hands are scrambling down to war positions. As they jettison the evidence, Hiram is watching on the telescope. Hiram tells them, “Shuck over m’lads, get that strongbox and we’ll be back for ye in an hour, and stay under until you can breathe the air. Buey, rope, anchor, he tosses it at the centre of the splash. There isn’t much wind, Hiram knows that they can outsail him for a bit, but when they out of the lee of the horn, the wind will open up. He promises to be back in an hour when the potion wears off and tells him he needs every sailor aboard to handle the ship.

Down in the Depths
The line pays way way out. They are finally far enough out to meet the Kraken’s people. They have the box and merely want to talk to you about it before you go. Skum look mostly human, but they are capable of stripping down and turning into Slimefish. They are the hagfish people, and can bring a wash stream of slime twisting all around you, while their friends finish you off. Then sahaguin attack, pinging the water with electric pulses and with a stun and finish attack. They are insanely deady and only with the healing of the Slimy Druidess do they make it through, if they have left her alive.

Hagfish Salty Elisa
She can take you to your box, since she just found it. If they shot to the bottom, this takes place over the box. Once she sees them in action, she doesn’t worry too much about taking them in and thanks them for rescuing her. She realizes she can help them and gives them a lift up to the surface. “Call me Aunt Elisa”, and “Don’t stay out of the water!” She shouts gleefully. 

Aunt Elisa
Professor at Bolsigners, she follows the ships out and salvages the strongbox. She has a long slimeline with grouper on it.



The Madman: “inside this bottle is a whole other world! Look, tiny people walking around a tiny village saying hi to each other and bye mom and eat you damn food and all those nice things. If I set then down and I can get one other person to hold hands with me, and we jump down the bottle!” If someone does it, they smash the bottle, otherwise he will take the bottle back into the knapsack. He is very careful with his stuff.

The Salt Sea

The Long Sea (the Fresh Sea, the lake, the rapids). 
There are Medes in the hills and surrounding the Baynas & Campoi in the lower cultivated areas surrounding. There are several islands of note.

The Floating City
Just as advertised. Mostly sailing about the caldera.

The Grass Desert
Between the two rivers.

Monah
Town at the breaking of the waters above the lake.

Iron Road
A ridge of ruddy stone, perpendicular to the rest of the limestone.

Askha'hle
Archlich of the Society

Malak
The harbinger of the other side. A messenger from the King, perhaps?

The Silver River
The Silver Mountain
The Silvermen have 
The Silvermen come in wooden sewn boats, made from fresh logs and hemp rope. They are looking at the sailing ships and making some interesting moves. Come down in a single run, a life’s run to turn wood and resin into silver and then to make it back again. “I told my baby I’ll be gone till the 11th month”. The river flows in the opposite direction about 1 every 3 years, down to the Silver Mountain.

The Erim
The Silvermen believe in two things, Iron and Horses. They are also taken with how well slavery works for them. They are very reasonable people otherwise, and can actually get together an army’s supply lines. They are used to building large armies and staging 3 year sieges to assault their enemies. The Orcs have long threatened them, and they look forward to using their allies to deliver them a powerful blow. This will be a good central conflict for levels 10-15. Niflar Halfshield, his half brother Silar Gloryshield is willing to join up and will even begrudgingly follow orders if the Stone King arrives. But he’s right about making an assault on the Horde. If the Sea People can be convinced to join, and if he can get Bore to let him establish a shipyard on the Long Lake, Gloryshield (Vamarm) will lead the Erim against the Orcs.

Lagash is a settlement the silvermen have established for themselves. Along the sea coast, riddled with ruined settlements, this one has survived the last Opening and is now establishing caravan routes between the rivers. A caravan route is also being tunneled through the mountains. Silar also has been building boats in Lagash. It has also become a huge illicit trade hub and the silvermen are fast becoming the largest slaver market on the coast. They have become too large a target to be ignored for the Orcs. They will be prepared for the Second Gift, or swept away by it, depending on whether they are able to make the changes to reconnect with Eschar. 

The Baynas
To the east and west of the long sea, there are 2 ancient reservoirs build long ago. They have excellent spillways and drain into the Long Sea, or can be dumped into the mountain. There have been cuts put into to increase the drainage of the Long Sea during drought, these are dangerous during spate and will need to be corrected or will flood the city.

The Elves, Rashesh
Keepers of the seas. The bringers of bright iron, made with fires on the beach. They arrived with great treasures 100 years ago, and have instituted the system of administrations and universities to build the legions. These are usually known as the… They refer to this land as the Golden Land.

The Lake People, The Cham, Champoi
These are the first inhabitants, before the Danoi Finders and the Sea People. They have simultaneously adopted the Elven system of government, while keeping enough pressure and threat of rebellion on them to require a large military presence. Lakash, Eshar of the Sands, Losh, and Halfwall are their principal cities. They are related to the Danoi in language, but their culture has been swept up in a fascination with the Rashesh.

The Danoi, The Sea People
They founded many establishments, including Halfwall; their units are the most elite of the city’s Warbands. The Finders are the original family of Halfwall and of the Library. Their works are foundational in the University. The Finders are currently the slumlords of Ub, and some of its most revolutionary elements. They have traveled down the two rivers, bringing with them a phonetic alphabet, Urnfield culture and fine iron and finer horses.

Hill People: Baba Yaga, the Wolves, Duke Lucan, The Night Stalkers
They have the Stalkers, Karesh, and Woodmen. There are two main sects up at the East Reservoir. 


Cedar Mountain: ships, vikings, miners and shipwrights. They bring the riverboat out to the seas and find it awesome. They are intertwined with the Sea Peoples, for good or ill. 

The Wolves Under Attack
Someone (probably the Host) tries to burn the town down. There are 5 different challenges, which Tzagim should know about. Esme Thornshield owns a small town that was destroyed, while the materials to destroy the East Reservoir (Tell Iona and Tell Kur are the two ruin-mounds skirting the reservoir).

Esme Thornshield  & The Exploding Town
Warband leader of the Prince’s Wolves. Her home town exploded and there was only one survivor. She is sure the Host is behind the attacks, and sends them to the Iron Gate to see what information they can gather. Also, there was a survivor of the explosion, being held by the Moska, and she wants to spring the survivor who is kept at the Bog Dogs. 
“This won’t be boring”.

The Bog Dogs
The will have a tough time breaking in, but with some contacts and moving the right pieces, they should be able to at least get access to the survivor. Esme might come along with them in disguise. Otherwise, they are to deliver her to Esme’s estate on Sheep Island. Either way, the Sappers catch up with them.

The Siege of Sheep Island
Two words: white phosphorus fire. The Sappers light the place up and send a fireboat to shore. The Clinkers run up the beach, forcing a melee, veterans and rogues. The bring mastiffs, a ton of them. There are some ancient blooded enemies of the Thornshields, and band called Blood Gang.

The whole wood catches in fire. The attack is more than overwhelming, it obviously involves several coordinated groups, a difficult-to-put-together mismash. Someone with very deep pockets indeed. The Blood Gang is out there to kill Esme, if they rescue her, the prisoner is re-captured, otherwise, they bear the brunt of an insane amount of Tearers before they slink off.

Falstaff will arrive and tell them how they can counter-track the prisoner. This might be because he had been approached, he discloses as much as he trusts them with. But they can track the prisoner. It is a tearer stronghold, the Breighton Brothers. They will have some work cut out for them. 

Throw me in Honey
The Brothers are the most closeted bunch you’ve ever met, think Proudboys who are allowed circlejerks. You probably *have* to kill these guys. For me. If they do so, Bore will have had time to get in and out and destroy evidence. If they get done too quickly, he will send someone to show up with a group of soldiers and wipe the place. If they are really sneaky sneaky they can get some compromat on Bore.



What does compromat on Bore look like? Well, for one, he was working for the Host.

Esme – Zora Culkin
Bols 
Joanna Elb – Saj
Marius Keen – brusier for the Hospital – he wants them to find out where the drug Mull is coming from. He doesn’t want any trouble from the Tearers, so he intends to give them this information, as a gesture.
Yung will send someone to tell them of a missing person – someone’s daughter that he needs to get back in a quick and diplomatic way.

One Hot Night
Bols is throwing a cop party and will shop it by Esme or Joanna, depending on how things are going with the Erimesh. If it is Esme, everyone is talking about her losses and the slave trade.
Event: A Esharite Noblewoman is being an ass to the Erimesh and the Danoi. “Wolves from the hills” and “Flea-bitten barbarians in-exile”
Event: A man has clearly took too much Mull.
Main Event: Edo Rian is a celebrated writer/author. Sciber Meatus has gone absolutely bonkers over this guy. Edo Rian is totally innocently mindshielded. Bols will steer them clear from trouble with him/it. Lady Horne is still looking for her daughter, after that last scandal, she wants to work directly with the players and is willing to pay cash. Her daughter has been hanging out with Edo Rian and his lowlifes down at the Chippies. Another Host Prime will have a missing daughter and will want to piggyback, if there is any news to be had.

One Hot Night: The Goldsmith’s
There are two artisans working on casting a massive bronze sculpture. They have been up for 32 hours and are clearly bonkers. They are big fans of Rian’s, but they have heard that Rian lives with his parents. They’ve also heard about the rumors about the boggers.

One Hot Night: Rian’s Parents

They are wealthy, but have little knowledge of what their son actually does at the docks, but they assume he is a quartermaster, and are just disappointed he hasn’t joined the Host. They don’t know what an Edo is, but they do have just the right amount of classism to say the right things about the Savants. They will however let the players know that he frequents Ten Pins.

One Hot Night: Ten Pins
Yes Skyre Gowan Roan sells Mull, but she won’t tell them that unless she knows them, and knows they won’t sic the Hospitaller on her. Otherwise, she does know the Edos quite well, and can probably tell them more about Rian than anyone. Again, depending on how well they know each other, she can tell them that Rian has bought a new property on the w. Side of the Rock, on a very wealthy residential district called The Cliffs.

One Hot Night: Dust mephits
Rian has purchased an old Chapter House of the Tearers (perhaps one that needed some rebranding) The chapter house is decorated with twisted iron and lots of strange alcoves. There may be secret rooms with things like stuffed mermaids and lycantropes, maybe an owlbear or some forest creatures, anything that makes the players angry. Rian has hired some thugs and spy5es to provide cover for the front doors. Inside, there are several young members of the higher houses of Eshar. If they want to take these folks back, they will either have to get Rian to dismiss them, or bring them by force.

Rian has kidnapped a 

Operation Werewolf:
Hamfist has lost a Mill to some occupying Tearers and wants it looked at
He can tell you about several other projects, of other Mill owners who have had similar problems. He suspects someone at the Rock. Nobody expects Option Werewolf. Mostly Hamfist wants to know: who are his enemies? Around the same time, Fat Mat drops by and mentions that his bar is full of Tearers, and he has some stuff to stash. Hamfist shoves it all down a chute and then asks Fat Mat what is going on? Fat Mat suspects some movement on the part of the Rock or the Iron Gate.

Option Werewolf
It started with him feeling his oats, then he started to follow his nose. There has been an insane screed of arrests throughout the city. He says he’s not able to sleep at night, so he has been looking into a backlist of ledger indiscrepencies. At the same time, he is making major inroads into the blood trade. No one gets past his nose, eyes and ears.

The Wreckage He Leaves in His Wake
A Lumber Mill – Forester’s Mill. He put a whole batch of Foresters in Hospital and then had them put up for corruption charges. The party, if they scratch beneath the surface, discover stockpiled weapons or perhaps direct Host involvment. Bols is sending them signals, opening them up for the party to come in and investigate, picking up the pieces. There are wizards there? Fireball.







The Eye
An island with a single safeharbor, the beaches are the sunken ancient buildings, the sand below filled with wights. They are the keepers of the island, but if the players have the right credentials, they may let them pass. The mountain on the island, and then: a lake with another island. The descend into the saltiest salt flats in the world, and they start to see some totems. Several suns pass over, and they realize they’ve gone more than 8 miles. They are standing on salt and there is the corpse of an Iron Rose, and they descend into the Maw of the Gyre.

Joanna Elb
Lake merchant, has the most difficult position of having to work with the City and with Koinsung

Koinsung of the Long Lake
The lake can raise and fall over 16ft in a season. The stilt city, city of tusks. Several districts: Tuskharbor, Canal Lacrimose, Timocyst, Temple of Ianna.

Shay’s Shop
This is a mechanics shop for building almost anything out of iron. Silver and bronze are worked here as well, building nails and arrowheads. There are some weapons for sale, but they would be mostly second hand, anything else is made for orders. Lady Ava might be there, and if they know her history, they can help her find the Dagger, the Bowl, and the Staff/Egg.
The incubus, Obel runs the shop.

They will allow them to communicate with the theatre, if need arises. Pools of water.

The Beef Rake Hats
Doors say “Blood” and “Money”. They aren’t going to get out without a brawl and the Pole Bears will probably give them a fine one. Hopefully, things go well, and they manage to make friends. They will not give out any client information, but they will let them know of certain other deals that are going down in the periphery, if they actually don’t have a client involved.

There are always six guys at the bar. It is usually a masterclass. “Sometimes the war college sends their particularly pissy runts to the Beef Rake… Hats” He will finish with Hats.

Tyjerere 
Once he’s warmed to them ahem, knocked them around a bit, or let Bore do it if he’s around. If Nate Hound is around, he will mention that this is a punishment, not a training excercise (he gets that plenty) but a dumping ground for War College shits, which is a total lie. He also complains that his friend, Hatchaxel, has had such a rum go of it. This is to make him look stupid.
Tyjerere will tell them about the night in question. Drake had been recruiting for the Edo in this area. He had been working on a young group of newcomers, the Bog Dogs might know them.
If the Bog Dogs were involved, things don’t look good for anybody, esp. If Fred is running with them now. They go from two dogs to three dogs at that point, see Changes of the City.


If they come looking for information on Lampry Aunt Elisa He first explains pedantically that she is a wizard. 

The Dagger, They Black and White, White and Black, The Stag, The Sun
The Ten of Chinese
If they follow up on the Dagger, they will fall afoul of the  

 The Bowl, "myriad" (万) 
The vessel of Enki, the drinking urn. The naphtha urn. When they see it, they realize it is what it is.

The Staff
These are the words written on the staves

This is maybe a good time to reveal that Obel is an incubus. His masters may go up the chain a while.

Island of the Pyramids
The pools of chaos. They will meet with Kraus, an agent of Darker Faire who has been keeping an eye on things, he will let you know that Lord Saxon is on the island, and would meet with them.

Long Room with Strange Benches.
A clerical or voting chamber, fierce hierarchy lines. Lord Saxon will have dinner in the centre and while they eat he will let them know some things they may not already know:
The Ghost Ship’s Connections.
The Natural Colleges Experiment on the Island of Pyramids.
They found a labyrinth within.
Something about the Theatre.
The Experiment has become dangerous

Whereas the Stygian’s are trying to convince them: The could be Porter or better yet, Magnus Freeman. 
There is a great evil brewing in the Pyramid. Something left from the past?
The Host will soon land and take the island. Anything we want to know about needs to be removed now!
The evil must be stemmed. – use our secret tunnel
Can you take a one-way message to contact a spy in the Host? He must come in from the cold.


Out to the Island, Captain Buckfest, or Reggie the Lame’s nephew, will ferry them cheerfully telling them stories:
The people that go to the island without it’s permission don’t live.
You can crash at his warehouse, if you want to. It’s some money if you’ve got it.
Some really really horrible take on the horrors coming out of the lake. Solidly strangely strange.
The people of the Island aren’t very friendly, if you haven’t entered their religion.
The Island is unnatural.

Once on the Island, an unrelated faction will attack them (The Rashesh?) and they will have to sort out the confusion. This is when they first encounter a chaos leak. They have rings of communication back to the Shay or Magnus. If they answer: you pour out the liquid, you see a reflection with a bird staring at you, then it flaps away to find Shay. He appears, pulling on a scarf. He might immediately contact you to the Host, or try more diplomatic channels. This is his job. Do you want him to call in the Host, at this point?

And It’s A Labyrinth!
If Char is around, he is interested in it. It’s like an archiological dig, but he has little respect for the maker. It’s just a random-dimension maze, with impossible creatures randomly appearing in every room. But, there is just a shitton of treasure. Then there is the pit trap of jelly things and the remains of the souls still lost within. Also blade traps. Every door existing the hallway. Lined with the Codicies. The Codicies are in some sort of giant ancient trap.The trap can be disabled, and they notice that it already was disabled. The Host is ahead of them, spear headed by Nate Hound and the first warpacks – a prototype hill and silver alliance, excellent at crossing rivers and cruising islands. Anyway, there is a giant wurm. Then?

What’s then is the Hounds tearing into them, not believing a word they say. If they are put down they will thank them in the morning, and probably give them a favor. If they die in the street, the Host begins to investigate them more rigorously.

Then is a big trap, a bunch of things from beyond the beyond and badies babies. The babies want to eat the minds of everything living and everything dead.

galeb duhr a – the rock itself churning beneath the chaos. The dark tower approaches. And there on the shore is the beach and the madman, writing on bits of bitumen. He is there with a Chimera. It is interested in getting out, and food, in that order. The Chimera and the Carpenter. After this encounter, the madman becomes the Carpenter, or once he has been replaced. The Chimera declares that it is no longer a Chimera and it isn’t.

Proceeding, they find Char’s lab. They whole design palace. There are wizards of the Natural College there, conducting experiments with the tools of the designer. They are like monkeys banging on typewriters. They have found out a ton of stuff in the last 4 hours or so, but now they are beginning to get worried. There is something coming through, and they aren’t going to be able to evade it. They are like rabbits caught in a room. They are both trying to repair the apparatus, and respond viciously to anyone interrupting them. One of them is Timesick for 5 seconds ago. That is sooo sick. They would really love a break, but they are all nose to the grindstone. Ah, what is going on with you?

If they don’t have the trust of the Natural College, they will be put through some tests?

Area 1 the research floor done as series of tests to prove what they are saying is true to the Natural College. If they kill these guys they get tons of information and tons of brimstone.

They are savagely attacked by Natural College Monks. If they best them, they win their respect. Seriously?

They think they are in a safe, well ordered lab. There the Host is encamped and trying to find it’s way out, Nathan is there, and probably Bore? They get wrongly jumped again? Or maybe just confusion enough to hurt? Nope! The Halfhalls have a plant! This can be He jumps to kill them, but keeps his secrets close enough. He has things to tell them that they want to keep him alive for. He knows about the blastings, and the tools used to do it. Dispel magic, etc…
The Theatre kick the tiger. This should be a main NPC death scene, I think. Obel? Would he have been able to pose as an archmage? Magnus? if he was first in the gap, he may have survived in some way? Or perhaps they have to do a little blood spilling to get it started? I’m liking Obel, for some reason.

And.. Slaad start pouring through the gate.

The Game throws a Party

They are invited along with their Rebecca Horn. The Lower Halls may send Ehren Havelin and a group to keep things from breaking out in a fight. The Theatre will also be sending Obel (Scabb) or someone like him, along with some Baleheads.

The Three Trees
Huge Ash, Oak and Elder keep watch over this ancient grove. There are processions between the trees, and gift-giving. Lots of food and drink. Rumors here will talk of the movements of the Host into certain areas, the people are disappearing in the Forest.

The Madness
Infecting the whole party. A musician playing, she has escaped from the Hole, and madness is just? A fight breaks out, probably involving the party. The group attacking are a group from outside The Game, and they back down when the madness is quelled. Lord Saxon is very happy if no-one is killed. If they talk to the muscian they find out:

Clarissa the Geiger
The fiddle is made with bone and hair. She comes from an awful place. They call it Yarash Tesh, and it is a place of deprivation of mind and will. If they know most of how to get there, she can give them a story of what life was like. The mind was ripped apart, it isn’t so much that you have less will, but that it is spread thin, throughout the grass and trees. There is a long way to go into the wood.

They are jumped by Deep Pirates. They have sticky shields and nets. They are covered in grease, they can cast control water, water walk and spirit guardians.

Clarissa Says
They begin a game where you must do what someone says: “Name a tree!” “Do 5 push-ups!”. There is a naming game going on as well. Here are some of the Game’s moves:
Give me your firstborn. A young man, dressed for the occasion, steps over to their side.
Make a Scene. Talk in iambic.
Show me your true face. Clarissa shifts through a thousand forms and then comes back to her original.
More and more people join in, beginning the ritual of ascension to godhood. Each player must outdo the last in a furious game of danger, keeping the words obsure will allow them to draw back from the flames, but as they speak of things like love and hate, sun and moon, the Crones may have made it through and are certainly living it up. They will start to deescalate before Tiamat comes through. The players have a moment of catarsis. 
The BRH stop beating the daylights out of them.


Delegation to Lagash

Characters:
Coming with them – Bore?
Edo Rian– Danoi Archeologist, the Warden of Ram’s Shelf
Iat Ulmalik – Assassin from Eshar, from the Silvermen’s nobles, but not a real item in the area yet. Bore is here to make sure he takes the throne.

Scenes:
Slave-taking and the Weavers – Ettercap stats
Gruesome mass graves, chewed by animals
A man stuck on a pole, silver knife through his heart

Ram’s Shelf
Edo Rian – closeted Skum and master of mind control and transference. He can get them deepdraft. “For the right price” “What will you give me for it?”
Bols, pleeeease Bols – emergency control during the storm. He has caught several of the beasts and put their pelts out for sale.

Roma is there, and can purr them into talking to some of the townsfolk who saw what actually happened. This appears to be:
There are some people who might be willing to talk.
Niama can tell them: “The Shrine of the Moon” and “The Bishop's Hide”
There is a really hot-headed Prince on the premises.
And he might start murdering people.
Edo Rian has been destroying evidence. Burning a lot of paper.



Eventually, Rian will have to go with the desires of his heart: the transference to werewolf without danger to his life, and loyalty to his mistress in the upcoming battle with Aunt Agnus, who is coming with her sahagin army to put the Kraken down, before it destroys the world.

The Shrine of the Moon
They meet these groups in a wild concert of violence, they might be dancing? Posturing?
Jat and his gang of Silverbloods. These are lone wolves who have long been tired of the councils and the succession. Jat will deconvene the shrine if he is put into power.
There aren’t a lot of Silverblood family here, but they are quite quick, like weasels.
The Moska who are coming to pay their respects to their great friend, the spirit of the thing that is going to kill them all.
The Broken Ones – A band of Hill people with carnival like deformities, but they become something beautiful when they shift. Half are Moska. Roma is their leader.
The New in Towns – Fresh Meat – New Demons – these are recently lead by Fred, many of them work at the Natural College.
The Spirit Itself
The Prince’s Wolves – This guy is too cool to not be a main Character. Oh, this is Vamarm Silar Gloryshield, and he just crowned himself king. Silar will say “Well shoot, I’ve dabbled in fictions no more complicated than this”

Aunt Agnus
When they meet her, she is unfortunately storming the shrine with a spider army of craboids. She is in a bad MLM and she needs a way out. She might be the only one in this scenario who can make the connection between the Kraken and the College. Agnus will move to take out what she sees as an element too close: Edo Nain. She blames him for brokering this alliance. Her primary goal is the dissolution of relationships between the Silverbloods and the University. Edo feels the same way, and they are on the lookout for each other.

The Spirit holy cow this needs to be something from Aunt Agnus’s past. What is she (Aboleth)? How did she grow up? Was it rough? She is an old brain-eater. She knows her bread and butter. Aunt Elisa eats the past. The Kraken eats stories.

Edo Nain
He will draw them back into the past, when a Danoi army stood waiting to fight for the Blood Throne. They had marched from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and they brought with them 13,000 hoplites. The mountain passes had been well repaired and there had been no-one to accost them as they crossed to the City. They faced the armies of the Hill People, he saw their determination, their might, their paths, there they fought the Hill People. 

The Garden Path
You meet Jat and Roma, arguing but ultimately agreeing to share power when the others submit. Roma doesn’t believe this lie for a second, but she is watching for this to play out.

They are met with in force by Fred and the New Pups. Things are going to get a little tense. When the party shows up, Jat make take the opportunity to accuse Roma of stabbing him in the back and attack. Or he might be talked down, if he thinks there is still time to get further public. If the Game is back on, the Primals will now hit, otherwise, it’s just Agnus’s crew, with everything she can muster off The Shudder Cudder, a newly made ancient sea folk sloop.

The reward for brokering peace and getting the succession worked out is 1 week of foreknowledge.  +1 CHA The chaos is deep and tasty.

They hoist sail, and go howling on longships after the sloop, and they are attacked by pirates.



Anosbord - Fortress of Oblivion
Fastness of the Society, built on the East of the Rock. This is almost as well guarded as the Labyrinth.

The Esharites
They are strangely attractive, but in a flawed way, they have webbed hands, strange arms or legs. The Broken Ones come from this group and many of the Moska. They are the Esharites, the people of the lake.

Long Ago There was an Eternal Man. He first lived as a warrior, then chieftain, then king. He didn’t like to stay too long in one place, even before becoming a warrior, and so as king he had regularly over exposed himself to danger. His enemies took him and imprisoned him, and he basically just vanished. He waited for his friends to miss him and return to find him, he knew that they must be on their way (if only he knew), but he realized that the time was too late, but if he could buy them time.

There were two world, when they first collided, the other world immediately attacked, with overwhelming forces. some wise magicians decided that they should borrow troops from the future in order to overwhelm the opposition

The  Censors
The upper echelons of the Editors and then the Kursers and R
They were formed to purge the evil artefacts and traps, mindless invading machines, eastereggs that eat you, etc that were left behind when they were finally repulsed, with the help of the incoming sea, lake, river and sand peoples pouring like hell for leather toward the green.

The givers of the green
They believe in purging everything about the other side and its nature. They have dealt with invasion after invasion of disease and death, all coming from the other side, all of its effects. All of its systems are rearing to go to oppose the other side.

They maintain the brain caches for the Society. They can preserve the remains of the ancients in urns that when supplied with batteries, can allow you to extract information from the urns. 

Meanwhile, on the your first invasion, you will find a peaceful countryside, and a pile of boats, and hopefully a few months provisions? I’d prefer the war to begin in earnest. What is happening on the other side is in the gyre, and is about as friendly one time as it is unwelcome another. The gyre will hire them as mercenaries in an actually really bad and bloody struggle, some middle-of-the-world evil empire scenario. What does the worst kingdom look like?
The ruler-guy is dumb.
He wants something evil badly, because he’s sad.
Therefore he has started a secret cult to infiltrate their world and try and bring him across the divide.
One side is linear and the other relationships are split second and over stuff.
He really just wants ultimate power, but doesn’t seem clear on what that means, in bed.

But how about we have the opposite of those things? This seems to be a place where the worlds are in sync. He was only found by the First Fleet when he had escaped from prison. He left some favors behind him there, and the party may have to do some insavory business to cleanup his petty messes.

Bore 
Anytime they touch him, they will be recruited by Anax Shoe – a High Tearer who works for Bore.

and the Firest Forest. He will feed them some information, and only if they make an effort.
The givers of green are healers, with the Finders, somehow
The Standing Stones are all over the Necropolis, and parts of the Chippies are built on the Standing Stones.
The criminals in the city are retrained into the legions. 
People have been disappearing. There appears to be a pattern, and the Givers of Green seem to be really implicated, if he can lead them to their own conclusions, the better.
He wants to know what the Kracken is looking for.
He wants to know anything about the Natural College he can find.

The Finders Pact
There was an original pact between the Finders and the Champoi people. This was shelter and reverence for knowledge. The Finders built a system of administration and the dispensation of arm ies and the creation of infrastructure. They rolled out conscription and the recruitment of criminals and the conquering and integration of other groups. Champari was the language that contributed the most to Common, and they are interchangeable.

The Fall of the Finders
As the power of the city began to be administered through the Colleges, the Finders found themselves pushed to the older, less desirable quarters. They remained as an important element in Eshar: founding the Fringe College’s, including their own elite Finder’s College. They found it difficult to integrate with the upper crust of Danoi and the Erimesh, remaining a subgroup of the Champoi. They have always held the coastal areas, but there power has moved into the shadows as they have moved into a period of waiting, watching the moon and the stars for movement.

The Firest has been gathering trunks in upon themselves, and twinned with spiders and nests of frogs, but the overwhelming desire is to go, to be on the move. The heart has been held too long, the worst of the groves planted by the old king to only use to build real ships. If they can find the plans to build the ships, then they will be able to get access to the old trees themselves. Depending on how the negotiations and results of the First Fleet is, if things are going poorly for the Navy, then some miracle woods might start to appear. Stuff made like wood, stained, but it breaks strangely. It also usually attracts spiders

After the outcome of the events between the Kraken and the Natural College, either this will be chitinous resin work or this comes from some independent spiders. Either way; it makes great boats. There are now spiders and ants crawling about, building things. They seem quite sociable and wholesome, if a bit strange.

Then Came the Host.
The closest allies to hand that the Sun King had were his half-brother Dagon.

The Problems that they keep running into are the results of the Natural College’s experiments on the unnatural creatures. Their fungus, their diseases. They are now the givers of green, the living shield, and they are prepared to make some ships. Please do ignore those mistakes we left behind us, I mean the squirrel guy was hilarious, right? He always grabs the Mcguffin and runs with it no?

This makes a lot of sense of these really strange things, being capable of enslavement and vise-versa, and they are being studied by the Students of the College Mi-Go and their colors out of space. These guys are deeper into the edges of everything than they should safely be. Luckily there aren’t a ton left of them, as there was an Academic War 2 generations ago, and a larger number of professors moved out into the Fringe, Extra and Inner Colleges.

The Sword of the King
A group of St. Andreas soldiers attack the players and try to take the sword. If it is with Halfshield, then this will either occur at the Slag Pits or up at Tell Yona if he has been restored as king. Otherwise, they may have it in their possesion, if Silar gives it to them.

There are at least a dozen veterans and officers involved in this attack, and it could turn into a running battle. If they survive, Saad Khan will find them where they hole up (unless it is the bothy). He has Human Mesius with him, who will help explain about the sword. Mesius explains that the sword contains the imprisoned soul of General Narses. TMesius and Khan have a plan to communicate with Narses.

General Narses
If there are near the pit, the return of Narses will trigger some tentacular action otyughs etc. Narses communicates via anepigraphic tags. They may be able to tell that these sigils are similar to those found at the House of Mushussu inTuskharbor. If they head that way, the trolldrops begin in earnest. The sigils are written primarily in ancient Eschar, but they occasionally go off in a language that is similar to Hill speak, render phonetically.
