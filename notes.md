The magic of conciousness is faith. The thing that asserts that what is happening around it is real -- this is why the truth matters so much to existentiallists, for example. What is the difference between my friend believing that if I drink I'll die and burn in hell, versus the reality of it? The Rat Hunt is reinstituted in the city by declaration of the party. House Beowulf in support of the Rat Hunt. At the same moment, Bore calls in all of his chips and wields Beowulf like a sword throughout the city to defend the walls. Th e city is under siege. Why?

When you pick up a book, you want to know all about it, where it came from, who wrote it when. But the other person doesn't have that luxury, but how much do you believe? How do you know what is true <and how much do you think you do> The future is more obscure, pleads the hopeful. How do I wish to believe, I do believe what I know to be true. But that is not all I wish to believe. My Faith is kept with an open mind, for things I might immediately dismiss. This is why the truth, in it's smaller, petty form is now so important to me. 

This man, this Edo Hiraam he is not styling himself. I beg you, keep your eyes about you. ... He is about to become very important to the city. He is to intercept Undeath and keep her from leaving the city. Either that or a messenger from The Warden of Wolf's Shelf Edo Rian come to pick her up.

The Warleaders of Jan Thornshield and Sarl Agab Thornshield -- this family has been caught up in [Titus-like](/f/the_silvermen.md) drama, but Trigan Lakoizh has sent his son ahead as warleader and remained in Lagash. Jan is a very successful warleader when things go well, and Sarl is for the rest. They make a very effective team. 

The city, meanwhile, is falling apart. House Beowulf's seats in the Society pull all of their weight. There is a meteor attack on Keys Island. They really try to take out Aunt Else's tower, and the whole College of the Mind. The Society would not be happier. This means that they meet a much newer Aunt Agnus once they venture upriver. She might remember them, but in the meantime, she would make a fun villian!

But people are made of politics, so when the invading army 

Bore will leave the city for a private meeting with Edo Rian and will try to negotiate a truce. He might need the party to escort him, or they may need to use this to put him away for treason. Bore will offer the Erimesh a deal, #TBD, perhaps the position of Emporer of Esher. If word of his offer reaches Hiram, there will be a rift that Yung will need to heal between them.

Moment: #moment for the first time they discover that Bore has convinced at least 3 different people that they are in charge of the city, they might cock an eye at him. "How many people think they are in charge of this city? The more the merrier, as far as I'm concerned. The Thornshields are good folk."

This is a DnD adventure where whenever there is a knowledge check, you should be ready with an adventure or at least and encounter. It shouldn't have to be the loot that the characters do the knowledge checks through, but more well-planned reveals. The fact that the characters can cast spells in a largely mundane world.

Sarl has made friends within the city, House Beowulf and the War College. Sarl had initially intended on delaying the attack, and keep accepting payments from the city. The University would have likely kept this on the downlow even. But the Warleader would not have it. He believes in the ancient truth: that the king of Eshar would be the king of the world. 

The Rat Hunt: the warrent

TBD: Echoes of last adventure. Feel free to start a session with last session's fight, if that is what the party wants. This might introduce to them the idea of retconning the past. But how the knots are tied are up to the dungeon master. I'll provide some basic rules. 

The Bet: The first time they bet someone something, they become the Bet:
They will bet on the PCs, first thing, or make them bet on themselves with his cash. He will reward them hansomely from his spoils and will send them flowers at his first chance.

If you have a McGuffin, have a battle for it! Single combat! But you're driving wombats! Or summoning lemures!

He pleads with them to see his point of view: "Just yesterday, I was suspecting that the Golemworks were going to assassinate me amd now I piecing together what happened to me... What year is it? Can some one catch me up a little bit? I'm afraid I've not got anything but concern for those... oh .. ok.. Well everyone I love is dead. What a wonderful day! 

When consipiericy theorists work to hard at texts, when they have deciphered what knowledge they have and dig past the bone into numerology, this is the story of the demons as they manifest themselves into the digital age. They are waking now in the era of the net, but they will begin to walk the earth.

The stories of our past, what we take infrom them, and what we build of them. This is the core story we are here dealing with, I feel it will be long lived.
